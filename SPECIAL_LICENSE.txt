As a special restriction, by submitting code that modifies the core compiler,
the core functions (platform independent functions such as if, while, for, etc), 
language constructs, optimizer, exceptions, tools, PureUtilities, Persistence and
Persistence Network, or any other portion that is unrelated to the Minecraft
aware portions, you agree to release this code into the copyright of Layton Smith.
Furthermore, the core language grammar is copyright Layton Smith, in all cases. 
Note that this does not affect the release license. All code is still released 
under MIT. In layman's terms, this means that you cannot submit code that adds 
Objects, for instance, and keep the copyright on it, you must release that to me. 

This is because I intend for MethodScript to live past Minecraft, and I do not
want to be burdened by license restrictions. In all likelihood, I will always
release the core under MIT, however, I am not willing to make any promises,
so please keep that in mind, and if me selling the software without crediting
you in the future makes you uncomfortable, please do not submit code to the core.

Code that relates to Minecraft itself will always be MIT licensed, and your
Minecraft related submissions are always released under MIT.
