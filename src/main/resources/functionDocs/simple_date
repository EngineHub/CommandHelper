mixed {format, [time, [timezone, [locale]]]} Returns a date of the current time (or the time specified) in the format you give. ---- 
Date and time formats are specified by date and time pattern strings.
Within date and time pattern strings, unquoted letters from 'A' to 'Z'
and from 'a' to 'z' are interpreted as pattern letters representing
the components of a date or time string. Text can be quoted using single
quotes (') to avoid interpretation. \''\ represents a single quote.
All other characters are not interpreted; they're simply copied into the
output string during formatting or matched against the input string during
parsing. The following pattern letters are defined (all other
characters from 'A' to 'Z' and from 'a' to 'z' are reserved, and a FormatException
will be thrown if they are used improperly):

Pattern letters are usually repeated, as their number determines the exact presentation:
* Text: For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 4 or more, the full form is used; otherwise a short or abbreviated form is used if available. For parsing, both forms are accepted, independent of the number of pattern letters.
* Number: For formatting, the number of pattern letters is the minimum number of digits, and shorter numbers are zero-padded to this amount. For parsing, the number of pattern letters is ignored unless it's needed to separate two adjacent fields.
* Year: If the formatter's Calendar is the Gregorian calendar, the following rules are applied. 
** For formatting, if the number of pattern letters is 2, the year is truncated to 2 digits; otherwise it is interpreted as a number.
** For parsing, if the number of pattern letters is more than 2, the year is interpreted literally, regardless of the number of digits. So using the pattern "MM/dd/yyyy", "01/11/12" parses to Jan 11, 12 A.D.
** For parsing with the abbreviated year pattern ("y" or "yy"), SimpleDateFormat must interpret the abbreviated year relative to some century. It does this by adjusting dates to be within 80 years before and 20 years after the time the SimpleDateFormat instance is created. For example, using a pattern of "MM/dd/yy" and a SimpleDateFormat instance created on Jan 1, 1997, the string "01/11/12" would be interpreted as Jan 11, 2012 while the string "05/04/64" would be interpreted as May 4, 1964. During parsing, only strings consisting of exactly two digits, as defined by Character.isDigit(char), will be parsed into the default century. Any other numeric string, such as a one digit string, a three or more digit string, or a two digit string that isn't all digits (for example, "-1"), is interpreted literally. So "01/02/3" or "01/02/003" are parsed, using the same pattern, as Jan 2, 3 AD. Likewise, "01/02/-3" is parsed as Jan 2, 4 BC.
Otherwise, calendar system specific forms are applied. For both formatting and parsing, if the number of pattern letters is 4 or more, a calendar specific long form is used. Otherwise, a calendar specific short or abbreviated form is used.
* Month: If the number of pattern letters is 3 or more, the month is interpreted as text; otherwise, it is interpreted as a number.
* General time zone: Time zones are interpreted as text if they have names. For time zones representing a GMT offset value, the following syntax is used:
** GMTOffsetTimeZone:
*** GMT Sign Hours : Minutes
** Sign: one of
*** + -
** Hours:
*** Digit
*** Digit Digit
** Minutes:
*** Digit Digit
** Digit: one of
*** 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Hours must be between 0 and 23, and Minutes must be between 00 and 59. The format is locale independent and digits must be taken from the Basic Latin block of the Unicode standard.
For parsing, RFC 822 time zones are also accepted.
* RFC 822 time zone: For formatting, the RFC 822 4-digit time zone format is used:
** RFC822TimeZone:
*** Sign TwoDigitHours Minutes
** TwoDigitHours:
*** Digit Digit
TwoDigitHours must be between 00 and 23. Other definitions are as for general time zones.
For parsing, general time zones are also accepted.

The timezone parameter can be specified as well, to change the timezone of the generated date. The
default is to use the system's time. To bypass the time parameter, you can either send time() 
(which is the default) or null. Valid timezone values are:
