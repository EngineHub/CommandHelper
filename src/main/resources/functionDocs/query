mixed {profile, query, [parameters...]} Executes an SQL query, and returns various data depending on the query type. 
See the extended information for more details. ----

The profile is either a string, which represents a pre-configured database connection, or an array, which
can include dynamic connection information.

The query is the SQL query itself, with question marks (?) that represent input parameters, and the parameters are the 
input parameters themselves. Compile time checking is done, if possible, to ensure that the correct number of 
parameters is passed, based on the number of question marks in the query. It is never a good idea to dynamically 
create the query, so a compiler warning is issued if a query is dynamically being built. 
See [[CommandHelper/SQL|this page]] for more details about the SQL module.

For SELECT queries, an array of associative arrays is returned. It is not guaranteed that the arrays themselves are 
editable, so this returned array should be considered \"read-only\". Optimizations will be added later to make this 
more efficient. For INSERT queries, either null or an integer is returned. If the insert caused an auto-increment to 
occur, that auto-increment ID is returned. Otherwise, null is returned. For UPDATE, DELETE, or schema changing 
queries, null is always returned. In the event that an SQL query is incorrect or otherwise causes an error, an 
SQLException is thrown. Only primitive data types are supported for the parameters, arrays are not.

==== MySQL Data Conversion ===

When inserting data into a MySQL database the data types are converted to match whatever the column type is. If the 
data you insert is longer or has more precision then the MySQL data type supports it will be truncated and may result 
in loss of data.

===== Dates =====

When inserting dates you should insert them as strings. The following are examples of correctly converted dates:

{| cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1" class="wikitable"
|- 
! MySQL Data Type !! MethodScript !! Notes
|-
| DATE || simple_date('yyyy-MM-dd', time()) || 
|-
| DATETIME || simple_date('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss', time()) ||  
|-
| TIME || simple_date('HH:mm:ss', time()) || 
|-
| TIMESTAMP || simple_date('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss', time()) || Even though a timestamp is numeric MySQL handles it the same as DATETIME.
|-
| YEAR || simple_date('yyyy', time()) || Alternately you can use a integer here too.
|}

All date and time types will be retrieved as an integer in milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. 
You can then use simple_date() to make it a human readable date string.

===== ByteArrays =====

MySQL data types: BINARY, VARBINARY, TINYBLOB, BLOB, MEDIUMBLOB, LONGBLOB and BIT with more then one bit will return 
as a ByteArray. It is however not required that you insert these types as a ByteArray (but it is supported).

===== Booleans =====

MySQL's BIT type with only one bit will be retrieved as a boolean. When setting the BIT type you can use a 
integer (0 or 1), string ("true", "false", "0", "1") and a boolean.
