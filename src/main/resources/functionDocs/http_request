void {url, callback | url, settings} Makes an HTTP request to the given url. ----
If the second parameter is a closure, it works the same as giving the closure to
the success parameter in the settings object. The settings object is an array
with the following fields, all of which are optional aside from the complete member.

{{Warning|text=There are a limited number of outgoing "slots" that can be used 
at any given time. This method is meant for quick completing requests, not lengthy requests.}}

|-
| method
| string
| null
| One of the following methods: %%enum|HTTPMethod%%. If null, it will use GET if there are no
params, or POST if there are.
|-
| headers
| array
| null
| Sets the headers for the HTTP request. Depending on if useDefaultHeaders is true or not,
certain headers may be set for you already. The array should be an associative array. The keys
of course will be strings, but the value may either be a string or an array of strings. If the
value is an array of strings, it will be parsed appropriately. If a cookiejar is supplied,
then the cookies will be automatically set in the headers, regardless of the value of the useDefaultHeaders
setting.
|-
| params
| array
| null
| An associative array of parameters to send. If the method is GET, they will be encoded into
the URL, otherwise they will be part request body. If the URL and the params include
the same parameter, the result is undefined. Regardless, the parameters will be encoded properly
when passed in as part of the params object, so it is recommended to use this always, especially
if dealing with user input or other possibly unescaped content. The subtype of the array may be any
primitive or an array of primitives. Sub arrays are encoded properly. If params is a string, it is
assumed to be raw POST data, and added literally to the request body, as is. When used this way,
you MUST set the method to POST, or an exception is thrown. The Content-Type header is not set
for you if this occurs, and will likely need to be set manually.
|-
| cookiejar
| array
| null
| An array of cookies. If the parameter is null, then cookies will not be managed at all by this
function, but if the array is empty (or already contains some cookies) then the cookies will be
managed automatically. If you intend on using cookies, it is strongly recommended that you allow
this system to automatically parse the cookies from the responses and set the cookies in the cookie
jar, as there are many security flaws that can be introduced with a poor cookie manager implementation,
and care has been taken to implement this correctly. Regardless, each cookie will be an array with the
following fields set: 

* string domain - The domain under which this cookie applies
* string name - The name of this cookie
* string value - The value of this cookie
* string path - The path under which this cookie applies in the domain
* int expiration - When the cookie expires. 0 means it never expires, because it is a session cookie.
The function will not send expired cookies, and will remove them from the cookie jar automatically. 
Session cookies cannot technically expire, and must be removed manually by you, if you are storing cookies
for a long period of time.
* boolean httpOnly - If true, this cookie shouldn't be provided to clients. In practice, this isn't very useful however.
* boolean secureOnly - If true, this cookie only applies in https, not http.
|-
| followRedirects
| boolean
| true
| If true, the system will automatically follow 3xx series redirect codes, and will then access the resulting
page, instead of simply returning at that point. The default is true, because more often than not, you shouldn't
care if a page redirects a few times first, and only want the resulting page.
|-
| success
| closure
| required parameter
| This is the only required parameter. When the request finishes on the background thread, it the resulting HTTP
response is returned to this closure. The closure should accept 1 parameter, which will be the HTTP response object,
which contains the following fields:

* string body - The body content of the response. This is usually the only thing of interest in the response.
* array headers - An associative array of arrays of the returned headers.
Often times headers are not repeated, so @response['headers']['Server'][0] for instance will be acceptable.
Headers are not usually needed for non-referencial purposes anyways.
* int responseCode - The response code of the request, for instance 404 for pages that aren't found.
* int responseText - The response text of the request, for instance "Not Found" for a 404
* string httpVersion - The HTTP version the server is using, for instance "1.1"
* boolean error - This bit is set to true if a 4xx or 5xx response code was received.

Note that it is considered a success even if the request results in a non 200 response, the error
handler is only called if the connection fails entirely. To check if the HTTP response is a valid
response though, you can check the error bit, or check the responseCode yourself.
|-
| error
| closure
| null
| If the request fails for whatever reason, this receives the exception generated. By default, the exception
is logged using the default uncaught exception handler.
|-
| timeout
| int
| 60000
| Sets the timeout that the background thread will wait for before giving up. 0 means no timeout, though this
isn't recommended, because this could cause future calls to http_request to fail, because there is a limited number
of web requests that can be running concurrently.
|-
| username
| string
| null
| Sets the username to use in response to basic HTTP authentication challenges.
|-
| password
| string
| null
| Sets the password to use in response to basic HTTP authentication challenges.
|-
| useDefaultHeaders
| boolean
| true
| Automatically adds the default headers to this request, unless specifically overridden. Note that some headers
simply cannot be overridden, for instance Host and User-Agent will ALWAYS be set. 
|- 
| download
| string
| null
| If this is not null, the file will be downloaded instead of returned, and saved to the specified location on
disk. Note that this is currently only enabled from cmdline mode, but will be added in general at a later date.
If this setting is set from non-cdmline mode, it is silently ignored.

|-
| proxy
| array
| null
| Sets proxy options. The array should have the following keys:
* type - One of either DIRECT (to bypass default system proxies), HTTP (for an HTTP proxy), or SOCKS (for a socks v4 or v5 proxy)
* url - The url of the proxy
* port - The port of the proxy --> 

The most basic usage is to get the html of the google homepage, not worrying about cookies
or anything complicated. That code is very straightforward:

<pre>
http_request('http://www.google.com', closure(@response,
	msg(@response['body'])
))
</pre>

The settings can adjust the more complicated options needed to do more complex tasks, but for
most basic needs, the usage is very straightforward. One thing you may more commonly find yourself needing
is cookie support. Cookies are managed by default by the framework, though you must provide a "cookie jar"
for it to use. The cookie is just an array which you give it, it can be empty at first, or you
can add cookies manually, if you know exactly what you're doing. After a "session" you can either
throw out all the cookies, or use http_clear_session_cookies on the cookie jar object, which will clear
the appropriate cookies for you. You may keep as many separate cookie jars as you like, and each is
considered a separate "session".

A FormatException will be thrown by the function itself if the URL is malformed.
