'''CommandHelper''' is an alias, macro, and scripting plugin for Minecraft that lets you:

* Alias commands like ''/battle'' to run ''/warp #battlearena''.
* Write a script to let players message each other while offline.
* Create an automated battle arena that automatically resets.
* Write your own /tp, /time, or /warp
* Do much more, from the simple to the complex, with zero Java code.

Remember that [https://github.com/EngineHub/commandhelper CommandHelper is open source].

=== Want to help? ===

CommandHelper is turning into a large project, and I would love for more people to help work on it. Don't know java? Great! There are things for you to do too! If you're interested in any of the following tasks, feel free to get in touch with me, and we can get you started!

* '''Documentation:''' There's lots of complexity in the plugin, and without solid documentation, it is nearly worthless. While some of the documentation is generated programmatically, many pages are not. The auto documentation generator leaves room for more detailed information too -- none of which is currently filled in :( From writing examples for each function, to working on the main documentation, and keeping the current documentation up to speed, there's actually alot to do that has nothing to do with coding!
* '''Testing:''' While a large portion of CommandHelper has automated tests, there is still no substitute for running [http://builds.enginehub.org/ beta] versions of CommandHelper on a real server. It would be nice to know that several servers have put it through the ringer before a version goes to full release status.
* '''Programming:''' From adding functions, to writing test cases, to working on the core aspects of CommandHelper, there are many different tasks to conquer.

=== Donations ===

Do you like the plugin a lot? I certainly don't expect donations, and the any money I receive won't influence the amount of time I spend on the plugin (well, maybe it will), however I do spend a lot of time working on it, and I certainly won't turn anything down if you want to say thank you! If you reeeeally want a feature added to Command Helper, and you're willing to pay money, get in contact with me, and we can discuss contract work, and we can discuss your needs, but otherwise, donations are just a way for you to tell me thanks!
