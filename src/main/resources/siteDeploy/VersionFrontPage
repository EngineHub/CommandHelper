'''CommandHelper''' is an alias, macro, and scripting plugin for Minecraft that lets you:

* Alias commands like ''/battle'' to run ''/warp #battlearena''.
* Write a script to let players message each other while offline.
* Create an automated battle arena that automatically resets.
* Write your own /tp, /time, or /warp
* Do much more, from the simple to the complex, with zero Java code.

'''MethodScript''' is the name of the programming language that CommandHelper uses, and there is a commandline version
of MethodScript as well, that you can use outside of Minecraft. MethodScript is an imperative, dynamic, event driven,
value-level, metaprogramming (reflective), structured (block-structured, semi-object-oriented, semi-class-based, 
recursive), parallel, partially strongly typed language, and is an active work in progress.

The developers of MethodScript do not recommend it (yet) for production or otherwise critical code, however,
as a quick scripting language, or for use in Minecraft, it is highly recommended.

Remember that [https://github.com/EngineHub/commandhelper CommandHelper is open source].

== Installation ==

Only the latest development build is officially supported, but there is some community support for older builds, which
you can get by joining IRC or Discord. For the latest build, head to 
[http://builds.enginehub.org/job/commandhelper?branch=master the build site], click the blue download button to the
right of the topmost build, and then download the <code>commandhelper-%%CURRENT_VERSION%%-SNAPSHOT-full.jar</code> file.
(Don't download the one without -full.)

Alternatively, for advanced users, you could download the sources and build it yourself locally. To do that, you need
git, maven, and jdk >= 8. Pull down the code with <code>git clone git@github.com:EngineHub/CommandHelper.git</code>,
then follow the directions in [https://github.com/EngineHub/CommandHelper/blob/master/README.md the README].

=== Bukkit ===
If you're using bukkit, throw the jar file in the plugins directory, and start your server. On first boot, the proper
directory structure with placeholder files will be created, which you can then edit. The configuration directory will
be called CommandHelper, and will be in the same directory as the jar.

=== Cmdline ===
If you're using the cmdline version, run "java -jar commandhelper-%%CURRENT_VERSION%%-SNAPSHOT-full.jar help" for a
listing of the possible commands, and "java -jar commandhelper-%%CURRENT_VERSION%%-SNAPSHOT-full.jar install-cmdline"
to install.
The configuration directory will be called MethodScript, and will be in the same directory as the jar. If the name or
path of the jar file changes, you'll need to re-install, so it may be prudent to name the jar with a neutral name that
does not include the version number.

==== Linux/MacOS ====
On Unix systems, you'll need to run the command with sudo. The installer will install an mscript bash file in
/usr/local/bin/mscript, which simply wraps the jar. Running ''mscript'' will launch the interpreter, running it with
a file will run that file, and using ''mscript --'' followed by a verb (such as help) will run the cmdline utilities.

==== Windows ====
<%NOTE|Windows support is still fairly experimental, and is not recommended
for normal use at this time. The uninstallation is unstable, and may require manual registry changes and other
manual work to uninstall or update, so use it at your own risk.%>

On Windows systems, you'll need to have launched your command prompt as Administrator. (To install on Windows
Subsystem for Linux, follow the same instructions as for Unix.) On Windows, an additional installer will run, which will
allow you to double click .ms files to run them.

== Tools ==

=== Syntax-coloring editors ===

Tired of writing your scripts in a plain black and white text editor? Try a syntax Highlighter!

The Visual Studio Code 
[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MethodScriptVSC.methodscriptvsc MethodScriptVSC]
IDE is the only officially supported IDE/Syntax Highlighter, and is most likely the most feature rich and up-to-date 
version, so it is highly recommeneded. To install, [https://code.visualstudio.com/Download download Visual Studio Code] 
(free, on all platforms), and install the MethodScriptVSC extension from the extensions tab.

If you prefer other text editors, there is community support for other text editors:

=== Feature requests and bugs ===

Long-term planned features can be found on the [[Roadmap.html|roadmap]], and short term features can be found on the
issue tracker. To request your own features or file a bug, use
[http://youtrack.sk89q.com/issues/CMDHELPER our issue tracker]. Known bugs can be found on the issue tracker.

If you would to request new functions, it is typically easy to add those, so please post your feature request in the
issue tracker. If you happen to find a bug in the program, please let us know so we can fix it!

=== Want to help? ===

CommandHelper is turning into a large project, and I would love for more people to help work on it. Don't know java?
Great! There are things for you to do too! If you're interested in any of the following tasks, feel free to get in touch
with me, and we can get you started!

* '''Documentation:''' There's lots of complexity in the plugin, and without solid documentation, it is nearly \
worthless. While some of the documentation is generated programmatically, many pages are not. The auto documentation \
generator leaves room for more detailed information too -- none of which is currently filled in :( From writing \
examples \
for each function, to working on the main documentation, and keeping the current documentation up to speed, there's \
actually a lot to do that has nothing to do with coding!
* '''Testing:''' While a large portion of CommandHelper has automated tests, there is still no substitute for running \
[http://builds.enginehub.org/ beta] versions of CommandHelper on a real server. It would be nice to know that several \
servers have put it through the ringer before a version goes to full release status.
* '''Programming:''' From adding functions, to writing test cases, to working on the core aspects of CommandHelper, \
there are many different tasks to conquer.

=== Donations ===

Do you like the plugin a lot? I certainly don't expect donations, and the any money I receive won't necessarily
influence the amount of time I spend on the plugin (well, maybe it will), however I do spend a lot of time working on
it, and I certainly won't turn anything down if you want to say thank you! If you reeeeally want a feature added to
CommandHelper, and you're willing to pay money, get in contact with me, and we can discuss contract work, and we can
discuss your needs, but otherwise, donations are just a way for you to tell me thanks!
