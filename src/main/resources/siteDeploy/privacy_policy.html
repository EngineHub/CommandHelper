    <strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
</div>
<div class='ppInnerText'>
    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a 
    privacy policy.  The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the 
    United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information 
    from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information 
    being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. -
