		<h3>General</h3>
		<p>
			The Persistence Network Viewer (PNV) allows for viewing and modifying of the contents of a Persistence
			Network (PN). A PN is defined by the persistence.ini configuration file. A network is made up of various
			data sources, but the network as a whole doesn't care where those data sources come from, or what the
			data format of each one is. The system as a whole deals with key-value pairs, where the keys themselves
			form a hierarchy, and can be visualized as a tree. Any data may be stored in the values themselves,
			including arrays. This help section does not cover setting up the PN, for more information on that, please
			see the documentation on <a href="%%wiki|Persistence_Network%%">the wiki</a>.

			The first step to using the tool is to connect to a data source. This differs depending on whether or not
			you are connecting to a local network (on the same computer) or a remote network (on another computer). A
			local connection is the easiest to set up, as it doesn't require any extra steps. Click File -> Load from
			Configuration... to open the Load configuration dialog, then select either Local or Remote.

		<h3>Local Connections</h3>
		<p>
			Local connections are the simplest to use. Simply specify the persistence.ini file that configures the
			network, and click Load. Normally this file will be located in your prefs directory. The configuration will
			be read in, and the data loaded into the window.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="remote">
		<h3>Remote Connections</h3>
		<p>
			Remote connections allow you to use the UI on your local desktop, and connect to a headless server.
		</p><p>
			Establishing a remote connection is a two step process. First you must run the pn-viewer server on the computer
			that you wish to access the PN on. To do this, use the command <code>java -jar %%jarName%% pn-viewer --server --port 12345 --password</code>.
			You may specify whatever port you wish, though note that the port must not already be in use, and if you use a port between
			1 and 1024, you must run the program as root. You may also leave off the --password argument, in which case no password
			will be required of clients, though this isn't recommended, and you may also follow the --password flag with the actual password, directly
			in the command. If the password isn't specified however, it will be prompted for interactively.
		</p><p>
			Once the server starts up, you can kill it at any point with Ctrl+C, or using your OS's task manager. The program's
			process id will be printed upon startup. The server version will also be printed out. Clients and servers can only connect
			if they are running the same version. (The client version can be found in Help -> About in the client.) Assuming everything
			started up properly, you will see that the server will now be listening for connections. You may also need to ensure that your
			firewall is configured to allow connections to the port you specified.
		</p><p>
			Now, you may open the client on your local machine, and select the Remote radio button in the Load configuration
			dialog. The host is the ip or url of the remote host. Do not include "http://" or any other url parts, simply use "example.com"
			or an ip address "1.2.3.4". The port is the same port that you configured the remote server to listen on. The password
			is whatever you specified (leave the field blank if you didn't specify anything). The remote file is the path to
			the remote persistence.ini file on the remote computer.
		</p><p>
			Once you have the fields filled out, click Load, and the data will be loaded from the remote server. This process
			may take longer than loading from a local connection, but the progress will be shown with a progress bar. As activity
			occurs on the client, it will be shown in the console on the remote machine. A constant connection needs to be made
			with the remote server in order to use the client.
		</p><p>
			Connections may be made to "localhost" using the remote connection as well. Once the remote connection is established,
			it stays up until you close it or it times out. Click File -> Close Remote Connection to close a connection without
			closing the application.

			As the data is loading, the progress bar and status indicator will become visible and give you feedback. Once
			the data is fully loaded, the tree on the left hand side will populate with the hierarchical key data. You may
			navigate to any key and click on it to load the value information on the right hand side. Some keys can be thought
			of as "folders"	and others thought of as "folders with data". The former is a key which has no data, but which
			serves as the parent for other keys. The latter is a key which has data and serves as a parent for other keys.
			Finally, "leaf nodes" are nodes with only data.
		</p><p>
			The namespace is the parent namespace of a key. The key is the actual key name. The source is the actual location
			of the data source that this key came from. The value type is the object type of the value, and the value box
			is the full actual value itself. If the value is a folder with no data, it will show <code>(empty key)</code>
			in the value type.
		</p><p>
			The data may be refreshed by clicking the Reload button in the top right, and it will be reloaded from the same
			place as it was initially loaded.
