Packet Jumper is an extremely advanced system that allows direct Minecraft protocol access via MethodScript.
In general, in order to successfully use this system, you must have a basic understanding of Java, and also
of the actual Minecraft protocol, though this tutorial can help bridge any gaps you might have in your understanding.
Code that uses this functionality is liable to break on every Minecraft version, and so should be avoided as best
as possible. Some tooling exists to help mitigate this churn, but it is always better to use other, existing API
methods if they exist, and this should only be used as a last resort. Scoreboard operations, for instance, are fully
covered by the API, and therefore should generally use packets to accomplish goals.

Also note that this guide has been written for 1.20.4, and while the overall procedures outlined will likely be
relevant for all versions, the specifics (particularly packet ids and names) are likely to quickly become outdated.

Packet Jumper heavily re-uses code from the original [https://github.com/steakteam/CHProtocol CHProtocol] extension,
but builds on additional features such as additional compile time type safety, and support for Mojang mapping names,
which are generally easier to read and understand. This obsoletes the CHProtocol extension. Big thanks to steakteam and
entrypointkr for creating the original CHProtocol.

== Installation ==

Packet Jumper does not work out of the box. As this is an advanced feature that can cause your server to crash,
cause clients connected to your server to crash, and generally cause havok, this is disabled by default, and won't
enabled if the current version of CommandHelper can't look up the correct mappings.

In general, to enable Packet Jumper, you need to do three things.
# Install the correct version of ProtocolLib for your server.
# In preferences.ini, set the use-protocol-lib value to true/on.
# Set the correct takenaka-mapping if you are running on a newer version than CommandHelper supports.

Step 3 is handled automatically if you are using a version of CommandHelper that supports your current server version,
but you can manually fill this in if you need to.

On first run, the mappings file specified (either internally or via takenaka-mappings) will be downloaded. This will
take a moment, as it is a large file.

== Version Differences ==
Note that in general, the Minecraft versions makes changes to the raw protocol on a regular basis, though it tends
to be rarer that established packets get major incompatible overhauls. However, as the protocol itself is not
officially supported, there is nothing stopping Mojang from changing the protocol, and completely breaking your code.
CommandHelper exposes the protocol to you dynamically, which means that CommandHelper itself only needs minor updates
on each version, and in general the same CommandHelper jar will work across versions. Your code however, will not
necessarily.

== Research Phase ==

At the base level, the entire Minecraft server simply exists to send and receive ''packets'' from the client. However,
the underlying APIs don't always expose direct access to do the things that you may wish to do. For instance, if you
wanted to cause an entity to have different movements depending on which player is seeing the entity, this is not
currently possible, as {{function|set_entity_loc}} actually moves the entity for all players. Under the hood,
however, the server is simply sending the "entity move" packet to each player individually. If we instead take over
on tracking the entity (or indeed, not even creating a real entity, and just having a "ghost" entity that we manually
track) we can instead send raw packets to whichever individual players we like. This has the effect of requiring us
to implement entity movement and interaction ourselves, in addition to using raw packets, but it is technically possible.

Before we can even begin writing code however, we need to understand exactly what task we are trying to accomplish,
and which packets will need to be used to make the player see what we are wanting. The first step is to figure out
which packet to use. In general, you'll want to familiarize yourself with
[https://wiki.vg/Protocol https://wiki.vg/Protocol], which is the community's primary documentation on the Minecraft
protocol. The wiki here is hand written, so in general, this isn't guaranteed to be accurate, but the guide is good
enough to give you an idea of what fields do what. Additionally, you can use
[https://mappings.cephx.dev/ https://mappings.cephx.dev/] to cross check packet information across various mappings.
CommandHelper exclusively exposes the Mojang mappings, regardless of what server you are running, and what mappings
it uses (it is dynamically determined and translated into the appropriate mapping for you).

In our example of having entities move differently for different players, we are want to find something that can
update an entity position. We're also wanting to run this during normal gameplay, and we want to send something
from the server to the client. Given that, looking at wiki.vg, we're needing to look in the Play and Clientbound
section. The "Play" section represents a "protocol", which is used at different phases of the client connection
lifecycle, but the Play category outlines most of the packets that are interesting once the client is connected and
playing the game. Since we're wanting to tell the client that the entity has moved, this is Clientbound, but when
listening for packets send from the client, we're interested in the Serverbound ones. Scanning through, we can
see a packet called "Update Entity Position". Reading the docs, it states that this is sent by the server when an
entity moves less than 8 blocks.

{{TakeNote=The ids and packet names change from version to version, so don't rely on the specific names and ids in this
guide.}}

The PacketId is 0x2C, the state is Play, and it is bound towards the client. There are 5 fields, entity id, delta x,
delta y, delta z, and on ground. The entity id is a VarInt, X, Y, and Z deltas are shorts, and on ground is a boolean.
The notes detail specific information about each field.

This information tells us everything we need to know to properly create the packet, though we need to convert this to
specific data to use in code.

Efforts have been made to standardize as much as possible across server versions, but that means that you need to use
naming conventions that CommandHelper recognizes. This full list can be obtained by calling {{function|all_packets}},
which returns an array of data that we can use to program against. Create an alias or otherwise grab the output of this
code, and put it in a text editor, preferably one that supports json syntax formatting and highlighting.

<%CODE|
console(json_encode(all_packets()));
%>

This provides a huge list of packet information, which is specific to the currently running server, and is subject
to change across server types and versions. The first step is to cross check and find the packet we are interested in
in this list. On wiki.vg, we saw that the packet id is 0x2C. In decimal, this is 44. In the list of packets
returned by all_packets(), find the packet with id 44, where the protocol is "PLAY". Note that there may be
multiple packets with the same id across different protocols, so you need to ensure you've found the right one.

There is a bunch of information in this object, which tells us specifics about the packet. Let's take a look at this:

<%SYNTAX|json|

The ''protocol'' field tells you which of the protocols this packet belongs to, and is needed both for the method
calls, and also for cross checking along with the id on wiki.vg. ''sender'' tells which direction the packet is going,
in this case it's clientbound because the server is sending it. ''superclass'' denotes the Java superclass of this
packet, and is only used for reference. If ''deprecated'' is true, you probably shouldn't be using this packet. Search
to find a better packet. Most often, these are packets which have just been replaced by another class which has
effectively the same functionality, but you may be forced to use the deprecated class anyways if there is no equivalent.
''name'' is the name of the packet that you will use in code, so make note of this. ''id'' is only for reference, and
should not be used except to compare with other references to the exact same version of the protocol. ''class'' denotes
the Java class of this packet, and is only used for reference. You'll also notice a blank ''comment'' field. This
is rarely populated, but when present, offers useful additional information about the field or class.

''fields'' is the most interesting property. This defines the different fields that are available in the packet.
Each of the field objects contains the following properties:

''name'' is the name of the field. This is the name you'll use in your code. ''type'' shows what type is expected.
The inner ''type'' shows the MethodScript type, which is the type you'll use, but the ''originalType'' shows the actual
Java type of the field. This is important to note, because it's up to you to ensure that for instance in the case of
a Java short, your value is in fact within -32768 and 32767, because otherwise you'll get a runtime error when
CommandHelper tries to shove the MethodScript integer (which is 32 bit) into the short (which is 16 bits). ''field''
is the field position, and is just for reference.

In this example, there are no generics, but let's look at a field where that is the case:

<%SYNTAX|json|
"profileIds": {
	"field": 0,
	"name": "profileIds",
	"comment": "",
	"type": {
		"originalType": "java.util.List",
		"genericType": {
			"originalType": "java.util.UUID",
			"type": "ms.lang.string"
		},
		"type": "ms.lang.array"
	}
}
%>

In this example, we also have a generic subtype. The top level object is an array, but it should be filled with
strings, which are in fact UUIDs. This information can't inherently be encoded in the MethodScript type system,
so it's up to you to ensure that you've populated it with the correct information. Generic types can have further
subtypes, so for instance you could have a list of lists of strings, in which case you would need an array of arrays
of strings in MethodScript.

Enums are another type that has special support:

<%SYNTAX|json|
"source": {
	"field": 2,
	"name": "source",
	"comment": "",
	"type": {
		"originalType": "net.minecraft.sounds.SoundSource",
		"enumType": "net.minecraft.sounds.SoundSource",
		"type": "ms.lang.string",
		"enumValues": [
			"MASTER",
			"MUSIC",
			"RECORDS",
			"WEATHER",
			"BLOCKS",
			"HOSTILE",
			"NEUTRAL",
			"PLAYERS",
			"AMBIENT",
			"VOICE"
		]
	}
}
%>

The ''enumType'' is just a reference type, but the ''enumValues'' list the valid enum values that can be sent. The
type is still a string though, and it will automatically be converted into the correct enum type.

Another thing to note is that some types are not (yet) supported. This could be due to the type only being supported
in newer versions of CommandHelper, or because support simply hasn't been coded in at all yet.
In those cases, the type will be "<UNSUPPORTED>", which means that this field cannot actually be used. However,
the plan is that all types will eventually be supported, and PRs that add support for missing types will generally
be accepted. Even if the field is unsupported, it may be possible to write the packet anyways, if the field's default
value (usually null or nullish values) will work, and for incoming packets, for reading the other fields, if the
unsupported types don't matter to your use case.

The list of unsupported types is added to a top level ''__UnsupportedTypes'' array. This is only for reference.

You also generally need to understand how the entire server works together, in order to provide a complete solution
to the problem you're trying to solve. For instance, in our example, even if we successfully send the packet to
move an entity for the individual player, the server will occasionally try to reset the entity position. You may not
inherently know what packets the server is sending or receiving, so you may need to use a tool such as
[https://github.com/adepierre/SniffCraft SniffCraft] which works as a proxy between the client and server, and can
log packets in both directions, which can give you an idea of what kind of packets you need to emulate and/or modify.

== Implementation ==
Once all the necessary packet and field information has been determined, we can begin implementation.

When sending packets out, the first step is to create a packet of the desired type. You'll need the protocol, direction,
and packet name.

<%CODE|
@packet = create_packet('PLAY', 'OUT', 'REL_ENTITY_MOVE');
%>

The protocol for this packet is PLAY, we're sending it out (as opposed to in), and the packet name is
''REL_ENTITY_MOVE''. Next, we need to write to the relevant fields with packet_write. Say we want to move
the entity one block in the x direction.

<%CODE|
packet_write(@packet, 'entityId', get_entity_transient_id(@entityUuid)); // Packets require the transient id, not uuid
packet_write(@packet, 'xa', 4096); // One block in the positive x direction, there are 128 * 32 steps in one block
packet_write(@packet, 'onGround', true);
%>

Finally, we need to send the packet to the appropriate player.

<%CODE|
send_packet(@player, @packet);
%>

This will send this packet to the single player, which will cause the entity to move forward one block in the x
direction.

However, after a few seconds, the entity will move back to its original position!

This is because the server occasionally sends an ENTITY_TELEPORT packet to the client. We must intercept that packet,
and ideally overwrite the position in the packet to that of our "fake" entity position. In this case you could also
cancel the packet (all packet send and receive events are cancellable) but in this case it's probably a better idea to
overwrite the values, but for example's sake here's how simply cancelling it would look:

<%CODE|
bind('packet_sent', null, array(protocol: 'PLAY', type: 'ENTITY_TELEPORT', values:
		array(id: get_entity_transient_id(@entityUuid))), @event) {
	cancel();
}
// We also have to register for the events to start firing for these packet types.
register_packet('PLAY', 'ENTITY_TELEPORT');
%>

By default, CommandHelper doesn't actually register to listen to any packets, as this would be unnecessarily
inefficient. The {{function|register_packet}} function tells CommandHelper that it needs to start processing events
of the given type, and is required before the binds for these packets will start to be triggered.

{{TakeNote=In the REL_ENTITY_MOVE event, the id was named "entityId" and in ENTITY_TELEPORT, it's just "id". Luckily,
CommandHelper offers some additional compile time checks on the values array, if you hardcode the protocol and type
parameters, which is highly recommended. This will make it easier to quickly see if you have errors in your
prefilters.}}

We also need to handle the case where the player logs out and logs back in. In this case, the entity will be reset
back to the original location, because the server sends the SPAWN_ENTITY packet to cause the player to load in the
entities at first, but the trouble is, this includes the server-controlled position location, which is not where we
want the entity to be for this player. Also, in this case, we can't simply cancel the packet as we did for the
ENTITY_TELEPORT packet, if we did, the client wouldn't see the entity at all, we instead have to modify the
contents of the packet individually. In this case, we'll keep it simple, and only modify the x, y, and z parameters,
but there are others that you may need to modify as well, such as the velocity and angle, etc.

Unlike most events, we can't use the {{function|modify_event}} function, but we can write directly to the packet with
{{function|packet_write}}.

<%CODE|
bind('packet_sent', null, array(protocol: 'PLAY', type: 'SPAWN_ENTITY',
		values: array(id: get_entity_transient_id(@entityId))), @event, @entityId) {
	// This is up to whatever your logic is, to get the location for the entity on the per player basis
	@pos = _getEntityPosition(@entityId, @event['player']);
	packet_write(@event['packet'], 'x', @pos['x']);
	packet_write(@event['packet'], 'y', @pos['y']);
	packet_write(@event['packet'], 'z', @pos['z']);
}
// Don't forget, we have to register to get events for this packet type.
register_packet('PLAY', 'SPAWN_ENTITY');
%>

This is likely the best handling for the TELEPORT_ENTITY packet as well, rather than cancelling it, since this will
prevent desyncs from moving the entity without any way to recover.

So, if you don't know which packet events you need to intercept, how can you find that? One of the easiest ways is to
use a packet sniffer, which will log incoming and outgoing packets to your client. This can be used to zero in on the
packets you need to care about, but will take a bit of sleuthing. Using
[https://github.com/adepierre/SniffCraft SniffCraft] for instance, we can intercept the packets, and print the packet
data for relevant looking packets, compare that to the wiki.vg and other docs, and see if that is the packet we're
interested in intercepting. A warning, this is not necessarily easy, and you may not find answers for what you're
looking to do, instead requiring reverse engineering to get there. Hopefully with the tools provided in this guide,
you will be able to get a head start on any detective work.

== Conversions ==

For some types, conversions are obvious, a field with a Java int type accepts a MethodScript int type. However,
for more complex type conversions, it is not always obvious. This table lists the supported conversions.
Implicit conversions: All numeric types (floating point, integers, including bytes), Strings and UUIDs (to string),
List/Collection/Set/EnumSet/Map/arrays except byte arrays to array, and byte arrays to byte_array.

Different servers have different class names, and so this list only gives you an indication of the specific class
name, the specific class name is obtained via ProtocolLib. More classes will be supported over time, see the
__UnsupportedTypes value in the return of {{function|all_packets}} for a list of types which CommandHelper does not
currently support.

{|
|-
! scope="col" width="40%" | Java Type
! scope="col" width="60%" | Conversion
|-
| Optional
| NOT SUPPORTED YET. An array with 0 items if the item isn't present, otherwise an array with the item at index 0. When writing, \
must be an array of length 0 or 1.
|-
| IChatBaseComponent
| A json string.
|-
| ItemStack
| The same item stack array used elsewhere
|-
| BlockPos
| An array containing 'x', 'y', and 'z' integers.
|}

Also note that double comparisons are done with a delta of 0.0001. If you need something more or less precise,
you must do so inside the event handler, not inside the prefilter.

== Unannounced Packets ==
Actually, the packet creation and packet logic doesn't strictly need to use known packets. Servers can dynamically
create packets, as well as extensions and other packets that are unknown to CommandHelper. For these packet types,
you can't actually use the string field names, but you can instead pass an integer, based on the field index, and
an attempt will anyways be made to set the value. You can use arbitrary strings in create_packet, and it will fail
if the system can't find the packet, but it will attempt to find the packet even if it's not one of the ones returned
in all_packets().

<%CODE|
// Sends the input directly to ProtocolLib to try to find the packet. This should be the java class name of the
// server implementation you're running.
@packet = create_packet('PLAY', 'OUT', 'net.minecraft.packetname');
packet_write(@packet, 3, 1.0); // Will send the input directly to ProtocolLib as is.
%>
