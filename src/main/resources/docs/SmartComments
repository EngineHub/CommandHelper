A Smart Comment is a comment field that contains somewhat structured data that can be used
both by your code and by the compiler, as well as being in an easy to read format, so that
readers of your code can get additional context.

In general, MethodScript supports four comment types, though two do the same thing.
Both # and // are line comments, and are completely removed from the source code during
compilation. The comment begins with one of those symbols, and ends with the start of a new line.
Comments that start with /* and end with */ are block comments, and can contain newlines within
them, though not currently other nested comment blocks. Like line comments, these are also
removed during compilation. Both of these comments are meant solely as context for the future
reader of the code, and have no functional purpose as far as the compiler is concerned, and
are thus discarded as part of the compilation process, and so the runtime has no knowledge that
these types of comments ever existed in the source code.

Comment blocks that start with /** and end with */ however, are smart comments, and the subject of this article.
These comments are not lost with compilation, and are able to be used in later stages of compilation,
to provide additional meta functionality to code.

<%NOTE|Note that this page outlines some expected functionality, rather than functionality that currently exists.
Where this is true, it is noted, but the format of comments can go ahead and begin using these conventions,
and as they become implemented, they will suddenly start working in your code. Thus, the standard is set in stone
now, and can go ahead and be counted on.%>

Given the following example, we can see the general format.

== General Format ==

<%CODE|
/**
 * This is the body.
 * This is part of the body, and contains an {@embedded annotation}.
 * @standaloneAnnotation with comments
 * @standaloneAnnotation can repeat
 * @standaloneAnnotationWithNoComment
 */
%>

There are a few things to point out. The general rule is that the comment block must start with /** and end with */.
On each line within the comment, the line may start with 0 or more spaces, a star, and then a space. This text is
stripped from the comment. The body text is the first part of the comment. Within the body, newlines and spaces are
preserved, other that the initial alignment spacing, as described above. Both body text and standalone annotation
comments may contain embedded annotations, which are the annnotations that begin with {@ and end with }. Embedded
annotations may also have additional text following the annotation name.

Standalone annotations are those that start with @. These are ended by a newline, and cannot contain newlines within
them. Standalone annotations may repeat, or they may contain no additional text.

== Usage in the compiler ==

The primary use of these smart comments is for providing formal documentation for the various commented elements.
By and large, the compiler itself ignores these values, though that's not always the case, depending on which
annotations are used. For instance, the @deprecated annotation will trigger a compiler warning when references to
the element are used elsewhere in code (not implemented yet). The primary use case is for generating automatic
documentation in various places, including the IDE (also not implemented yet).

Depending on where the comment is placed, the rules may be slightly different as well, and particularly which
annotations will be active, so check the documentation below for specific details, as well as documentation about
the various elements that support smart comments.

Smart comments that are placed on elements which do not directly support smart comments will not break - however
these will simply function as ordinary block comments, with the exception that the compiler may or may not retain
the comment in the runtime, unused.

== Usage in code ==

The larger advantage is being able to dynamically access these comment blocks within your code. This can be used
to power an automatically generating documentation system for instance, along with easily generated help text to
be provided to users upon incorrect usage. Currently, support for obtaining these comments is rather limited, with
support only existing for aliases. Additional usage will appear over time.


== Embedded Annotations ==

Embedded annotations are generally speaking meant to function almost like visual text modifiers, such as adding links,
emphasis, and other formatting such as this. This isn't enforced however, and custom code can use these however they
like. However, there are a few predefined annotations.

=== {@link} ===

The link annotation provides a link to another element in the code.

This is currently unimplemented and undefined.

=== {@url} ===

The url annotation provides an inline link to a web address. In general, the annotation should
follow the format {@url https://url.com replacementText} where the replacement text is the text that
is displayed, and the url is where the link goes. If replacementText is empty, the url is used as the
text.

=== {@code} ===

This is meant for references to literal code elements, for instance variable names, etc. The common use case
is to simply format the text with a monospace font, but could be used for syntax highlighting, etc.

== Annotations ==

Depending on the context, annotations can be ignored, or have different functionality. Ignored annotations are not
an error, they simply won't have any programmatic effects within MethodScript itself. You are free to use these
annotations in your custom systems in any way you see fit, though it is highly encouraged to ensure you are not
trying to fight the built in systems. Additional contexts may define additional annotations, with either server to
further document the element, or can even provide some functionality.

=== @seeAlso ===

The general format is:

@seeAlso https://url.com Description
or
@seeAlso element Description

This provides a link to either another element in the codebase, or an external web url. Note that the element variety
of this is not implemented or defined yet, but will have the same semantics as the embedded {@link} annotation.

=== @param ===

Documents a parameter. This is used for inputs to the element. The general format is
<code>@param value description</code>, where value is the name of the parameter without the at sign, and description
is free form.
