{{unimplemented}}

Unit testing is an important part of writing maintainable and correct code. In most programming languages, unit testing
is bolted on after the fact, but MethodScript elevates the concept of unit testing to a first class part of the language
specification itself.

At the lowest level, MethodScript provides the core resources needed to properly do unit testing, using special language
support for things like mocks, private member access, and other common unit test paradigms, that require unwieldy and
cumbersome third party libraries to support.

== What is Unit Testing? ==

In general, unit testing is a mechanism to test individual units of code (hence the name). This is opposed to
integration testing or functional testing, though the unit testing framework can be used to do integration testing as
well. 

In a unit test, the block of code that is under test is the only thing that should actually be run. Functions often have
external side effects though, (such as when calling a method that makes an http call, the server would actually be hit
with an http call) which is usually undesirable. There are a number of solutions to this, and the correct one depends
heavily on what type of test you're writing, and what your desired outcome is. In general, there are three main types
of ''test doubles'':

* '''Fake objects''' (or ''fakes'') actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes \
them not suitable for production (an in memory database is a good example).
* '''Stubs''' provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside \
what's programmed in for the test. Stubs may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub that \
remembers the messages it 'sent', or maybe only how many messages it 'sent'.
* '''Mocks''' are objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected \
to receive. 

Fakes and stubs are already possible to achieve if your code is written in such a way as to take full advantage of
interfaces and dependency injection. For instance:

<%CODE|
public interface MyInterface {}

public class MyImplementation implements MyInterface {}

public class MyStub implements MyInterface {}

public class MyFake implements MyInterface {}

MyInterface @mi = getNewImplementation();
%>

Assuming that during unit testing, you provide a new instance of MyStub or MyFake, then the rest of the code in the real
methods will work as intended. This pattern is often times useful when you have more complex objects, or for integration
tests, where creating mocks over and over is tiresome. However, the downside of this approach is that you have to write
your code in such a way as to support this, and anyways, if you are writing integrations with third party code which you
cannot change, this might be impossible anyways.

=== In come mocks ===

In general, a mock framework is a framework that allows easy yet powerful stubbing/faking, but instead of using real
objects such as MyStub or MyFake in the above example, the framework generates what can be thought of as a stub or a
fake on the fly. In addition, a mock framework usually contains mechanisms for verifying that the mocked object was
called in a certain way, with certain parameters. Additionally, the "code" in the mock can easily be modified at runtime
by the test code, so that the behavior can mimic realistic scenarios, with relatively little effort.

For existing mock frameworks in other languages, they are usually quite good, but due to various limitations in the
language, there are some key drawbacks. For instance, final classes cannot be mocked, because mocks in these
languages are just classes that are created on the fly, and extend a given class, so if the class cannot be extended, it
requires even more cumbersome and more complex frameworks to do the mocking. Private methods and fields cannot be
accessed by the mocks, and static methods cannot be mocked. These limitations make mocks useless in some cases, and
makes it impossible to do a proper unit test. Often, this code is tested in integration or functional tests, but it
can be quite a large process to do so, and in theory, if a mock would work, it would be ideal. Given that, MethodScript
provides built in support for mocks, including support for mocking final classes, private methods, and static methods.

In addition, global functions can be easily mocked as well.

== Unit Test Framework ==
In addition to support for mocks, MethodScript provides a mechanism for running unit tests. Most importantly,
MethodScript defines some generic annotations, which can be used by all test code, but it also provides a basic runner
for the tests. Third party libraries could provide alternative runners, and in fact, when integrating with an IDE, the
default runner is not used. Much of the unit test framework is inspired by JUnit 5, so if you are familiar with unit
testing in Java, these concepts should not be much of a leap.

=== Example ===

Let us suppose we are writing a Calculator class. The following code could be used to unit test the calculator. Let us
first take a look at the abbreviated Calculator class.

<%CODE|
public final class Calculator {
	private double @memory = null;
	private double @currentValue = null;
	public double add(double @a, double @b) {
		double @r = @a + @b;
		this->setCurrentValue(@r);
		return(@r);
	}

	public double subtract(double @a, double @b) {
		// ...
	}

	public void clearMem() {
		@memory = null;
	}

	public void setMem() {
		@memory = @currentValue;
	}

	private void setCurrentValue(@currentValue) {
		this->currentValue = @currentValue;
	}

	private static void printMsg() {
		msg('Hello from a static method!');
	}

	// ...
}
%>

Our unit test code that tests the add method might look like this:

<%CODE|
// Note the TestSuite annotation here, which adds the test class to the framework
@{TestSuite}
public class CalculatorTest {
	
	// The Test annotation tells the framework that this method is a test method
	@{Test}
	public void testAdd() {
		// assert([message], expected, actual)
		assert("Add is broken!", 4.0, new Calculator().add(2, 2));
	}
}
%>

You may name the test method whatever you like, but the return value should be void, and the method should not take
any parameters.

The testAdd method shows that we expect a return value of 4.0 when we add 2 and 2. If these values are not equal, then
the test method will throw an AssertException, which will signal to the unit test framework that this test has failed,
and the test will end. The other tests in the suite will continue to run, however. We can also mock methods, using
the mock framework, which may be useful to bypass some methods that are not under test. The when() function is used
to assign mock functionality for a particular method, and is a method with special runtime support, which does not
actually execute the parameter passed to it. verify() is special in the same way.

<%CODE|

	@{Test}
	public void testMock() {
		// First, we need to create a mock of the calculator. mock() returns a new mock object of the appropriate type,
		// using type inference, but it is possible to specify a subclass, if that is desired, i.e. mock(SubCalculator);
		Calculator @c = mock();
		// By default, methods do nothing, and return a default value depending on the
		// return type. In the case of a method with a double return type, 0.0 is returned. This line demonstrates that,
		// but doesn't actually test the calculator class
		assert(0.0, @c->add(2, 2));
		// Next, we set up the mock methods, so they return some different value when 2 and 2 are passed in.
		when(@c->add(2, 2))->thenReturn(4.0);
		assert(4.0, @c->add(2, 2));
		// For other inputs though, we still will get the default, because we haven't specified it.
		assert(0.0, @c->add(100, 100));
		// We can make it not care about parameters with the any() type:
		when(@c->add(any(), any()))->thenReturn(42.0);
		// This is a shorter but functional equivalent:
		when(@c->add)->thenReturn(42.0);
		// Now 42.0 is returned for any combination
		assert(42.0, @c->add(1, 1));
		assert(42.0, @c->add(12, 5));
		// We can also mock static methods
		Calculator::printMsg(); // Hello from a static method!
		when(Calculator::printMsg).thenDo(closure() {
			msg('Hello from a mocked static method!');
		});
		Calculator::printMsg(); // Hello from a mocked static method!
	}
%>

This example is not useful, because we are not passing the Calculator object to another object, but merely demonstrates
how mocks work. In this case, it's more useful to use a ''spy'' instead. A ''spy'' works more or less like a mock, but
unless otherwise instructed, will execute the real method in the underlying object. Unlike a mock, however, creating
a spy does need a real instance of the class. If the class has a no arg constructor (even a private one), and this is
the appropriate constructor to call for the test, then nothing additional needs doing. However, if you wish the object
to be constructed with another constructor, you can provide the instance to the spy function.

<%CODE|
	@{Test}
	public void testSpy() {
		// Create the spy first
		Calculator @c = spy();
		// If we wanted to construct our own custom instance
		Calculator @c2 = spy(new Calculator('string', 1, 2));
		// Create a subclass of Calculator instead
		Calculator @c3 = spy(SubCalculator);
		// Here, unlike the mock, you can see that the method returns the valid value
		assert(4.0, @c->add(2, 2));
		// We can still mock a method though, to override the functionality, in exactly the same way as a mock
		when(@c->add(2, 2))->thenReturn(42.0);
		assert(4.0, @c->add(3, 1));
		assert(42.0, @c->add(2, 2));
		// We can revert back to the default behavior both for mocks and spies using remove_when.
		remove_when(@c->add(2, 2));
		// We can also verify that certain methods are called from the mock or spy, including private methods.
		// Note that setCurrentValue is private, yet from within the test code, we can access it anyways. We set the
		// number of times we expect this method to be invoked, with the given arguments, in this case, any() (We could
		// leave that off, and just do verify(@c->setCurrentValue) as well.
		verify(@c->setCurrentValue(any()))->times(3);
		// Given that we called add 3 times in this test, this test should pass. 0 is a valid option, meaning that we
		// don't expect to have called the given method at all during the course of the lifetime of the mock.
	}
%>

Global functions can also easily be mocked, using the same general syntax, with the exception that all arguments must
be mocked, there is no shortcut for leaving off the arguments.

<%CODE|
	@{Test}
	public void test() {
		when(read('file.txt')).thenReturn('fake file text');
		assert('fake file text', read('file.txt'));
		// Bad:
		// when(read).thenReturn('');
	}
%>

In some cases, a more complex mechanism needs to be used, particularly when the item under test does not return a value,
but interacts with a value passed in, most generally a closure. In that case, you can use thenDo to give it an action to
do when it is called, rather than having it return a value. The closure sent to thenDo will recieve the arguments that
were passed in to the original function.

<%CODE|
	@{Test}
	public void test() {
		// Assume that we expect MyObject->myMethod to call http_request, but we don't actually want to make a real web
		// request. This is the pattern we can use.
		MyObject @o = spy();
		// distinguish between http_request(string, closure) and http_request(string, array) by providing the type
		WhenMeta @http_request = when(http_request(any(), any(closure)))
			// The type of any() is mixed, so we must accept mixed as the url. Since we specified the second argument
			// is a closure, however, we can define that as such here as well.
			->thenDo(closure(mixed @url, closure @callback) {
				execute(array('body': 'http request body'), @callback);
			});
		@o->myMethod();
		// We can verify that the method was called. when() actually returns a WhenMeta object, which we can use to
		// verify interactions.
		verify(@http_request)->times(1);
	}
%>

Private methods may be called directly from within the test code, and this is not a compile error.

<%CODE|
	@{Test}
	public void test() {
		Calculator @c = new Calculator();
		@c->setCurrentValue(10); // Not an error
		assert(10, @c->currentValue); // Also not an error
	}
%>

== Scoping ==
In general, tests should be isolated activities. This allows for tests to be run in parallel, prevents dependencies on
test run order, and makes writing tests easier to visualize. To support this notion, MethodScript enforces test
isolation at a low level. TestSuites are mostly just a logical grouping of tests, but if a method in the test suite
is marked as @{BeforeTest} or @{AfterTest}, then these methods will be called before and after each @{Test} method.
However, each test is run within its own environment, which is not shared with other test runs. Any changes made to
static values (including mocking the behavior of static methods) or other memory based structures are not saved.
Furthermore, the persistence network is backed by a
memory based implementation, the actual persistence.ini file is completely ignored. {{function|read}} and 
{{function|write}} go to a memory backed VFS, and http_request is blocked from making actual http calls (the function
may be mocked to simulate a web request, however.)

However, there may be legitimate reasons to allow side effects. This is allowed by using the allowSideEffects parameter
of the @{TestSuite} annotation. This is false by default, but if set to true, then for that test suite only, none of
the external restrictions are enforced (persistence network, read/write, http_request). Additionally, within the test
suite, the state of the environment is not reset before each test, though @{BeforeTest} and @{AfterTest} are still run
before and after the test. There is also a guarantee that tests will run in order, from top to bottom, and they will
not run in parallel. In general, this has many drawbacks, however, and will considerably slow down your unit tests, so
should be used sparingly, if ever. Generally, the better solution is to refactor your actual code and tests such that 
the tests can run indepenedently of each other.

== Integration Testing ==
In general, the unit test framework can be used without mocking, and across larger sets of objects to accomplish what
is known as integration testing. The line between this and unit tests can be blurry anyways, but strictly speaking,
unit tests should not interact with external objects (other than through mocks). But often times, there is little value
in doing such a limited test, as the real test lies in the interaction between various objects. In this case, you can
use the unit test framework, minus perhaps the mocks, and this is a perfectly acceptable use of the framework.

== Functional Testing ==
Functional testing, on the other hand, works more like a black box test. The program as a whole is run, as if run by a
user. In some cases, this is the most desirable test type, but the unit testing framework does not provide support for
this.
