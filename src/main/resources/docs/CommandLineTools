=== Explain Like I'm 5 ===
==== Windows ====
First, open a command prompt. Hit WindowsKey+R, type "cmd" in the box, then hit 
enter. A black box should appear. <code>cd</code> to the directory your plugins
are in, for instance, if your server was located at <code>C:\Server\</code> then
you would run <code>cd C:\Server\plugins</code>. Type <code>dir</code> to verify
the name of the CommandHelper jar. This may be different depending on what you
named it, but you'll use whatever it's named in place of <code>CommandHelper.jar</code>.

==== Linux ====
Open a terminal. Depending on your linux distribution, this will be different, but
the program is likely called "Terminal". Change to the directory your plugins are in.
For instance, if your server was located at <code>/server/</code> then you would run
<code>cd /server/plugins/</code>. Run <code>ls</code> to verify the name of the 
CommandHelper jar. This may be different depending on what you named it, but you'll
use whatever it's named in place of <code>CommandHelper.jar</code>.

==== Step 2 ====
Run <code>java -jar CommandHelper.jar</code> from your prompt. You will see the
help listing. Each tool is it's own "verb". The syntax for running a particular
tool is <code>java -jar CommandHelper.jar &lt;verb&gt; %%NOWIKI|[<arguments for this tool>]%%</code>

See the section below that shows the help listing for more details about each tool.
