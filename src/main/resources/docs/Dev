If you are interested in running the dev versions, you can find the latest build at the 
[http://builds.enginehub.org/job/commandhelper/ Build] site. Dev builds are usually stable, however, should the light 
next to the build be red or yellow instead of blue, you should probably avoid that build. In general, you should stay in 
the IRC channel ([http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=CommandHelper irc.esper.net #CommandHelper]) in case there are 
issues, so they can be quickly resolved, and you can be notified of potential problems, and new builds. The website 
is for the dev build, so you can have documentation for the newest builds. IRC is the preferred method of bug reporting, 
however the forum or dev.bukkit.org are also ok.
