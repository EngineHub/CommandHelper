File options are a way to granularly control options for a single file. Some file options affect the compiler directly,
others are simply used by the reflection mechanism to provide info during runtime. Unrecognized file options are
ignored, but are otherwise not an error, however, you should prefix all custom file options with "x-" to prevent future
conflicts if new file options are introduced.

The general format of a file option is: <code>option: value;</code> where the semicolon is optional for the last value.
However, some file options are booleans. For booleans, either "true" or "on" are considered positive values, and "false"
or "off" are considered negative values. Furthermore, leaving the value off entirely, e.g. <code>option;</code> is
equivalent to <code>option: on;</code>

The file options must be defined at the top of the file, and can only be proceeded by comments, and start with 
<code>&lt;!</code> and end with 
<code>&gt;</code>. Newlines within the file options are acceptable. If, within the value, you need a literal
&gt; or semicolon, you must escape it with \, so <code>\&gt;</code> or <code>\;</code>.

Some examples:

== Examples ==
<%CODE|<! strict >%>
Enables strict mode.

<%CODE|<!
    strict;
    description: A description of this file;
>%>
Enables strict mode and adds a description to the file

<%CODE|<!    
    strict: off;
    description: Description
>%>
Disables strict mode for this file and adds a description.

Below, the various file options and their effects are described:

== strict ==

Enables strict mode for just this single file. See the page on [[Strict_Mode|strict mode]] for a discussion of what this
mode actually does.

== suppressWarnings ==

Suppresses the given compiler warnings for this file. The list should be comma separated, but can contain multiple 
types.

<%SupressWarningsList%>

== name ==

This should be the name of the file. If it exists, and the file name does not match this value, the compilation will 
fail.

== author ==

The author of this file. This value is not used currently, but will eventually be available in the reflection 
information.

== created ==

The date this file was created. This value is not used by the compiler, but is perhaps useful information for future 
readers of the script. This will eventually be available in the reflection information.

== description ==

A description of this file. This value is not used by the compiler, but is perhaps useful information for future 
readers of the script. This will eventually be available in the reflection information.
