Many of the features MethodScript offers are valid to be used from the command line. As more and more features are 
added, the potential for MethodScript to be a scripting language used throughout your system, even for non-minecraft 
related things, increases. To this end, MethodScript now has all the basic capabilities needed to write scripts from the 
command line.

==Installation==
To install MethodScript on your system, download the CommandHelper jar, and place it in a sensible location. If you are 
already running a Minecraft server with CommandHelper installed, the jar file there will suffice, though you may wish to 
place a copy of it elsewhere, as otherwise your persistance databases and settings will be combined. (Keep in mind that 
using serialized persistance is NOT thread safe, and so you run the risk of corrupting your database by having two 
instances of CH running at once, if they are both writing to the persistence db.)

Run the command:
<pre>sudo java -jar CommandHelper.jar --install-cmdline</pre>
This will install MethodScript to your system, as a globally accessible interpreter. To uninstall, run:
<pre>sudo java -jar CommandHelper.jar --uninstall-cmdline</pre>

This currently only works on unix systems, but Windows will be supported eventually.

==Usage==

The main difference between MethodScript being run from CH scripts and running on your system is that Minecraft specific 
functions will not work. All other functions will work, or at least attempt to work just the same. To facilitate 
commandline usage, a few extra features have been added, namely the sys_out, sys_err, and exit functions. These 
functions will not be quite as useful in game, but will still work to some extent. Additionally, command line parameters 
can be sent to your script, and those are placed into the @arguments variable, which is defined before your script runs, 
as an array, as well as the $ vars, which will be populated from $1 - $[x] where the number is the position of the 
variable on the command line. $, the final var, is also defined, and it contains all the arguments passed in, 
concatenated together. $0 is a specially defined variable, and is the same as Bash's $0 variable, which is the path that 
this script was executed with. Due to its less often usage, it is excluded from @arguments and $.

All functions work basically the same, minor differences may exist, but they are noted in the documentation. The glaring 
exception to this is that calls to Minecraft functions will not work at all, and in fact, may simple error out by 
throwing a stack trace or something. This is not a bug per-se, you must simply not use those functions.

To use the cmdline tools, there are three methods. First, the cmdline interpreter can be accessed by simply running 
<code>mscript</code>. This simply runs the command line interpreter, which is in fact the engine for all the other 
methods. The second method is to use <code>mscript <filename></code>. This executes the file, assuming it is a valid 
pure mscript file.

Finally, you may execute a MethodScript file on unix systems by executing it directly. To do so, be sure to put 
<code>#!/usr/bin/env /usr/local/bin/mscript</code> at the top of your file, then set the file's execution bit, 
using <code>chmod +x <filename></code>. Then, you may simply run <code>./script.ms</code> (assuming the filename is 
script.ms). Using the cmdline tool "new" you can create a blank file with the file set up correctly. 
[[CommandLineTools#Tool listing|See this page]]

Arguments may be passed to the program as such: <code>./script.ms "Argument 1" "Argument 2"</code>, which will be 
available via the means outlined above.

Please note that while probably already massively useful, this is an work in progress feature, and may have plenty of 
bugs, and is not intended for widespread adoption yet, though is being officially supported.
