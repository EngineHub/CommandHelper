{{unimplemented}}

A manifest file describes information about the project as a whole, including things like the version number,
author name, etc.

== Comments in the manifest ==

It is often times useful to add comments to a configuration item, but alas, manifests use json, not xml, and you
can't put comments! Not to worry though! Every element is defined with a "comment" field, which is totally
ignored by the manifest system, but can be added anywhere you wish in your configuration to add information
for the reader of the config file.

== Manifest Objects ==

The root object is defined as such:

// TODO just link to the ms.lang.manifest.ManifestRoot file.
