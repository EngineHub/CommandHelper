MethodScript provides various methods for connecting to and running SQL commands.
The methods exposed ALWAYS use prepared queries, making your code far less prone
to database injection attacks, as well as better compile time checks where possible.

The SQL framework uses JDBC to connect, so any database backend compatible with
JDBC can be supported with MethodScript. You must have an SQL server set up and running
already, which is beyond the scope of this article.

== Configuration ==

To simplify connection information to various databases, MethodScript allows two
ways of connecting to a server. Either via ''profiles'' or via in code connection
information. When connecting statically, connection via profiles is the preferred
solution, since it makes coding easier, and makes it harder to accidentally leak
database credentials when sharing code. To create a profile, create a file in the
<code>profiles</code> directory. The name of the file should be the profile name.
If any directories are in the profiles folder, they are ignored. The profile file
is an xml style file, which should contain the same information that is used during
the connection if you were using the query method that takes a connection object,
however, if the profile doesn't exist at script startup time, it will immediately
cause an error, instead of waiting until runtime, if possible. If the connection information
is incorrect, that is a runtime error. Connections to different SQL server types
may require different connection information, so you'll need to see the connection
configuration information for each supported server type. In general, the configuration format
is as follows:

<pre>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<profiles>
	<profile id="profileName" type="mysql">
		<host>localhost</host>
		<port>3306</port>
		<database>db_name</database>
		<username>username</username>
		<password>password</password>
	</profile>
</profiles>
</pre>

Essentially, the connection information is specified via xml tags per profile, and
connections can be referenced by id. In the following tables, the Tag column
is the xml tag in the profile (in the above example, the username and password
tags) and the status column tells you if the tag is required or optional. In all
profiles, the id attribute is required, as is the type element. At startup, the xml is validated,
and errors are reported, and must be corrected before continuing. 
The XML must be valid. If these attributes are hard
coded, then the connection information specified should be specified as an associative
array, subject to the same policies as the xml for required tags.. For instance,

%%CODE|
array(type: 'mysql', database: 'db_name', username: 'username', password: 'password')
%%

is an example of a valid runtime specification for a mysql connection. In any place
that the profile is specified, an array of this type may be provided instead.


=== SQLite ===

SQLite is the simplest SQL version to configure. No extra installation is required,
as databases are plain files, and is supported out of the box. The base connection
information required is just the file tag, though other information can be
specified.

=== MySQL ===

MySQL requires a separate MySQL server to be running, either remotely or locally.
For more information about setting up a MySQL server, look for more information
on the MySQL website: http://www.mysql.com/

== Making a query ==

All queries use a standardized form of SQL provided by Java, though vendor specific
SQL statements are supported, depending on the connection type. Learning SQL is
beyond the scope of this article, and the article assumes you know at least basic
SQL, however, if you need a refresher, [http://www.w3schools.com/sql/ this site]
can provide a basic tutorial. Additionally, the [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/ MySQL reference manual]
is very well written, and most of the information in it will apply to other database
systems as well. You may also consider purchasing a book on SQL for more in depth learning.

The {{function|query}} function is the basis for all queries. Connections are
automatically kept for the duration of the script, so there is no need to worry
about manually opening and closing connections to the server; the runtime will
handle that for you. During each query, there are only two required parameters,
the connection information (either a profile name or a connection array) and
the query itself (and any statement parameters). 
All queries use a "prepared statement" format, which ensures that SQL injections are not possible.

{{TakeNote|text=Though you can bypass prepared queries by doing concatenation, this is
extremely bad practice, and will cause a warning to be issued. Query strings should
be hardcoded and the prepared statement engine will insert the parameters automatically
and safely.}}

The query function returns an array (in the case of a select) or various other
return types, depending on the SQL statement. For selects, an array of associative arrays
with the results is returned. For inserts, null is returned, unless the statement used an auto-increment, in which
case, that value is returned. Deletes and updates return the number of rows affected. All
other operations return null. 

Some common examples follow, though the full SQL language is available.

=== SELECT ===
A simple SELECT:

%%CODE|
@result = query('profileName', 'SELECT * FROM `table` WHERE id=?', @id)

/*
 * The returned result would look something like this:
 * array(
 *     array(columnName: 'value1'),
 *     array(columnName: 'value2')
 * )
 */
foreach(@result, @row){
	msg(@row['columnName'])
}
%%

As you can see, the id is automatically placed into the statement, no escaping
required, and there is still a guarantee that no SQL injections will occur. Essentially,
if @id were a string, this would translate into the following code:

%%CODE|
query('profileName', 'SELECT * FROM `table` WHERE id=\''._escape_this_parameter(@id).'\'')
%%

which as you can see could much more likely lead to errors or unsafe usage, and is much
harder to read.

A more complex SELECT:

%%CODE|
@results = query(array(type: 'mysql', database: 'db_name', username: 'username', password: 'password'),
	'SELECT `table1.id`, `table2.name` FROM `table1` JOIN `table2` ON `table1.attribute`=`table2.attribute`
	.' WHERE `status`=? AND `online`=1 AND `group`=?', @status, @online)
%%
