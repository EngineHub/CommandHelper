CommandHelper comes bundled with a server wide event debugger and profiler. In fact, this can be used by itself, even if 
you don't use the rest of the plugin at all. To explain this feature fully, it should first be explained what a profiler 
and debugger actually are, a bit about Bukkit itself, and who the intended users of this feature are.

==What is a profiler?==
A profiler allows you to get statistics about the performance of a particular portion of software. For instance, let's 
say you write some software, and it writes out information to a file. In general, to see how well this performs, you use 
this pseudo code:

<%SYNTAX|java|
int start = System.currentTimeInMillis(); //Get the current time, as a Unix timestamp. This is our "start time"
myFunctionThatWritesOutAFile(); //Call the function we are wishing to profile
int timeToRun = System.currentTimeInMillis() - start; //This is now how long it took our function to run
%>

Ok, so now we know how long it took to run. We could echo this out or log it to a file, or do any number of things with 
this information. But now, what if there were other factors involved? What if maybe sometimes we ended up writing a 
large file out, or maybe we're trying to test it out on different computers, and some of them are slower than others? 
Maybe we want to get an average case for this. In order to calculate an average, we have to get several runs of the 
function to test it. This is where perf4j comes in. Perf4j is a framework that allows for easy calculations of 
statistical information about a process. We simply have to log the information we are interested in to file, and perf4j 
converts it into an easy to digest summary of the data. We will discuss this more below, when we talk about how to 
actually activate the profiler in CommandHelper.

==What is a debugger?==
In general, a debugger is a program that hooks into another program, and allows us to see information about that program 
at a given snapshot in time. More complex debuggers will allow us to pause program execution, and dynamically examine 
parts of the program, but in general, the simplest debugger is a print statement. If we were writing a program, and we 
wanted to see what the following value was:

<%SYNTAX|java|
String fileContents = SomeClass.ReadInFile("/path/to/file.txt"); //Read in a file
%>

then the simplest thing we can do is:

<%SYNTAX|java|
System.out.println(fileContents); //Print the file contents to the screen
%>

This is a simplistic form of debugging. How CommandHelper fits in with all of this is discussed below.

==Who is this feature meant for?==
===Profiler===
The profiler is meant for anyone that wants to dig down further and analyze the performance of their server. Let's say 
that you've recently installed several plugins, and now your server performance has slowed to a crawl. Instead of 
uninstalling these plugins one at a time, we can log performance, and quickly determine which plugin is the problem. 

Also, developers of other plugins can take advantage of this, by installing CommandHelper next to their plugin, and 
having CommandHelper log performance of their plugin. This will allow them to figure out what parts of the plugin need 
to be focused on for improvement.

===Debugger===
The debugger is designed to help server owners diagnose problems for event related issues. Say that we have two plugins 
that aren't behaving well together. We can turn on the debugger, target that particular event, and print out information 
about what plugins did what, and in what order as well. 

In addition to server owners, the debugger can provide more information for plugin authors. It's decently difficult to 
set up a proper debugging environment for your plugin, so instead, it may be easy enough to install CommandHelper, and 
have it log information about events as your plugin is running.

==A word on Bukkit and Events==
Ok, so now we know what a Profiler and Debugger are, but what exactly can be done with CommandHelper specifically? 
CommandHelper has a play-dirty mode already. This mode allows for CommandHelper to hook deep in to Bukkit's event 
system. By default, play-dirty mode is off, because I break many rules to get it to work properly. Essentially what 
happens is that CommandHelper ''injects'' it's own event firing system into Bukkit, essentially replacing Bukkit's own 
system. With play-dirty mode, all events actually fire off through CommandHelper. The original purpose of this was to be 
able to fully manage commands. Since CommandHelper doesn't do anything initially when you install it, any action taken 
by the plugin is a direct command from the server administrator. Because of this, I take certain liberties to overwrite 
and manipulate other plugin's behavior, which would normally be unacceptable. 

With this framework in place however, it is very easy for us to see and respond to any event on the server, even events 
that are being delivered to other plugins. So, for the profiler, we simply start a timer right before we fire the event, 
and stop it right after it finishes. For the debugger, we spit out information about information in the event, which 
plugin it's going to, and what listener is responding to it. With the addition of the perf4j framework, we can also then 
aggregate performance data.

==Usage==
Both the performance logger and debugger can be enabled on-the-fly, through standard CommandHelper functions. These 
functions are both restricted by default, and can be completely disabled (and are by default) in the preferences file. 
Set allow-debug-logging to true and allow-profiling to true to enable the respective functions. To properly use the 
profiler, the debugger must also be enabled. To enable the entire operation to occur, CommandHelper must be allowed to 
inject into the event system, so play-dirty mode must be on as well. There are also preferences to establish where data 
is logged to, the debug-log-file, and profiling-file settings. These both support date and timestamp variables, so you 
can automatically segment your log files by time.
===Debugger===
The debugger has several levels of verbosity. The lower the verbosity level, the less information is displayed. This is 
a double edged sword. On one hand, less information is easier to understand, but may not contain the information you 
actually want. On the other hand, too much information can cause data blindness, the information we want is there, but 
it's buried deep within noise, and so isn't useful. This is why there are three mechanisms for focusing the information 
that is displayed. Verbosity, event filters, and plugin filters. 

The main function to enable logging is the debug_log_events function.

<%CODE|
debug_log_events(toEnable, [level, [logToScreen]]) 
%>

toEnable is a boolean, and turns debugging on or off. level is an integer from 1-5, and sets the verbosity level of the 
output. logToScreen is a boolean, which defaults to false. If set to true, in addition to logging to a file, it will log 
to the server console. This can be useful for plugin developers, but if you are running a server, then logging to 
console will cause the same information to log to to two places. If you a server owner, it is better to use the tail -f 
command on a unix machine to view the debug data live. 

This will enable the debugger, but we haven't set any filters yet. Output won't actually occur until we set filters 
though, because the event filter is a whitelist filter.

<%CODE|
set_debug_event_filter(arrayOfEventsToDisplay)
%>

This takes an array of the event types we are interested in. Calling this function will replace the old filter. The list 
of all the valid event types can be displayed by calling dump_listeners(null), which will display all the event types. 
Provide an array of event types you are interested, and they will be logged. If you '''really''' are interested in every 
single event, you can call set_debug_event_filter('*'), which will add all the events.

In addition, you can add filters to narrow which plugins you are interested in with the set_debug_plugin_filter. This is 
a semi-whitelist. If the list is empty, all plugins are logged, but if you add 1+ plugins to the list, only those 
plugins are shown. The name of the plugin may not be it's commonly referred to name. To determine a plugin's name, you 
can use the dump_listeners() function.

<%CODE|
set_debug_plugin_filter(arrayOfEventsToDisplay)
%>

===Profiler===
The profiler is activated using the enable_performance_logging function. Events are filtered using the 
set_debug_event_filter and set_debug_plugin_filter, though debugging and performance logging can be activated separately 
from each other.

If an event is logged, it is written out to the performance logging file, and then CH itself is done. So how do we get 
performance data from this? First, you must download the 
[http://repository.codehaus.org/org/perf4j/perf4j/0.9.16/perf4j-0.9.16.jar perf4j library]. Place this file in the 
folder that your logs are being created in, then open up a terminal, and run <code>java -jar perf4j.jar --help</code>. 
This will display all the actions you can do with perf4j. Once of the more useful features is to create an aggregate 
summary of all the data. <code>java -jar perf4j.jar nameOfLogFile.log -o aggregate.csv -f csv</code> will create a csv 
file that can be opened in excel. There are other options as well. (I have not quite yet figured out how to generate 
graphs.)

==Example Scripts==
These tools can be controlled on the fly from within a script. Here are example scripts that will start and stop the 
profiler/debugger, and can be modified to suit your needs.
<%ALIAS|
/dump = console(dump_listeners(player_command_preprocess, 5)) msg(concat(color(red), 'Dumped.'))

/go = >>>
	set_debug_event_filter('*')
	debug_log_events(true, 1, true)
	set_debug_plugin_filter(array())
	enable_performance_logging(true)
	msg(concat(color(gold), 'Performance logging started'))
<<<

/halt = >>>
	debug_log_events(false, 1)
	enable_performance_logging(false)
	msg(concat(color(gold), 'Performance logging stopped'))
<<<
