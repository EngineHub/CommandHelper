This guide serves as a technical standard for the Persistence Network format. The guide is
not meant for script writers, but rather those that are trying to write integration tools
to work with data sources created by the Persistence, or otherwise understand the internals.

== General ==

Data sources are meant to be completely agnostic to the value that they are storing. All data
must ultimately be able to be stored and read in as strings. The upper level code submits a
string (typically a json string, in the case of MethodScript data types) and the data source is
responsible for storing that data in the best way possible, then returning the data
exactly as originally stored. Each data source may further encode the string sent in,
but it must decode it first, before returning the data.

Keys are composed of zero or more namespaces, plus the key name. In practice, there
will always be at least one namespace. Namespaces must follow the regex "[a-zA-Z0-9_]+"
though namespaces may not be named exactly "_". This is to allow some data sources that
can use a hierarchy to reserve a place for a value stored at the root of a namespace.
For instance, assume we want to store a value at "a.b" and "a.b.c".  In a hierarchical
data source, "a" would be an array, and so would "b", and "c" would be a single value.
But doing this prevents the single value from being stored in "b". Consider the json:

%%PRE|
With just the value in a.b:

{
    "a": {
        "b": "value stored at a.b"
    }
}

With just the value in a.b.c:

{
    "a": {
        "b": {
            "c": "value stored at a.b.c"
        }
    }
}
%%

As you can see, given this hierarchical data structure, it is impossible to merge
the two structures as is. Instead, the special key "_" is reserved for "root" values, and
should be taken to mean "the value stored here is the value for my parent namespace".
Merging the data shown above yields this json:

%%PRE|
{
    "a": {
        "b": {
            "_": "value stored at a.b",
            "c": "value stored at a.b.c"
        }
    }
}
%%

This hierarchical structure only applies to Data Sources that actually have a hierarchy
of data, not flat storage, for instance, ini.

When a data source is considered a "flat" data source, the key is a single dot
separated string, i.e. "a.b.c".

== Data Sources ==

A list of the data source types and any notes specific to that type follow:

=== INI ===

INI data is a flat data structure. INI data follows the standard INI format, i.e. <code>key=value\n</code>. Lines
starting with any amount of whitespace then <code>#</code> are considered comments, and are ignored, though
lines with a hash character elsewhere in the line are taken as literal hashes. Since
keys may not contain non-numeric characters, this will never cause an issue for
programmatically generated data. Newlines indicate the end of the value, but internally,
all newlines will have been escaped to "\n" before transmission to the data source, so
this shouldn't cause an issue either. The value that is grabbed if there are duplicate
keys is undefined.

=== JSON ===

JSON data is stored using a hierarchy. The values are double encoded with json to prevent
any issues with differentiating namespace hierarchy vs internal data structures, though
this causes extra space to be used.

=== MySQL ===

MySQL data is a flat data structure. Data is stored in a table with special column requirements. 
There are three columns in the table, and the table name is determined by the user.

The columns are defined by the query:

<%SYNTAX|sql|
<%MySQL_CREATE_TABLE_QUERY%>
%>

Selections, inserts, etc, must take the key and binary hash it with the UNHEX and MD5 functions: 
<code>UNHEX(MD5('key'))</code>. This provides a way for the key to be unlimited length, yet still
allow the table to be indexed. Though unlikely, collisions are possible, but the plaintext key is
also used in queries to ensure that the correct row is affected.

=== Redis ===

Redis is a flat data structure. As Redis is a key-value data store, it is an exceptionally good fit
for the Persistence Network. Keys and values are stored as is, using the standard Redis commands.

Storing a value uses SET, getting a value uses GET, and clearing a value uses DEL. For multi get,
KEYS is used to determine the keyset (with a filter to reduce the search set), which then uses
GET to get the individual keys.

=== SQLite ===

SQLite data is a flat data structure. Since TEXT columns can be indexed in SQLite,
the key column is the primary key. The database may contain multiple tables, but only the table created
with the query:

<%SYNTAX|sql|
<%SQLite_CREATE_TABLE_QUERY%>
%>

will be used.

=== Serialized Persistence ===

Serialized Persistence is a flat data structure. The data is stored using the 
[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/platform/serialization/spec/protocol.html Java Serialization Protocol].
There is a single object stored, a HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; of the key/value pairs.

In Java code, this uses the ObjectOutputStream/ObjectInputStream utility classes. As
Strings are serializable, this method should always work, and is immune to future changes
in the data itself.

=== Temporary Memory ===

Temporary memory is a flat data structure. Since this data is completely internal,
no other processes can access the data. However, other code running in the same
memory space can access the data via the MemoryDataSource static methods. The
data is stored in a Map&lt;String, String&gt;. All the methods in the MemoryDataSource
class are thread safe, so multiple threads may concurrently access those databases
with no issues.

=== YML ===

YML data is stored as a hierarchy. The format follows the standard YML format, which
is plain text.
