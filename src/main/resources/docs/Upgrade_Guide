Updating to new versions of CommandHelper or Minecraft can sometimes require updates to your scripts and/or extensions.
Below is a reverse chronological guide to help you with the most notable of these changes to quickly update your code.

----

== Minecraft 1.17 ==

* GRASS_PATH changed to DIRT_PATH (converted automatically where possible)
* Cauldrons are split into 4 materials: CAULDRON, WATER_CAULDRON, LAVA_CAULDRON, POWDERED_SNOW_CAULDRON
* GLOW_ITEM_FRAME is a separate entity type that behaves exactly as item frames
* All ores now have a deepslate variant (eg. DEEPSLATE_COAL_ORE)

----

== Minecraft 1.16.1 ==
The following breaking changes exist:

* PIG_ZOMBIE entity type was changed to ZOMBIFIED_PIGLIN. This matches the material change from ZOMBIE_PIGMAN_SPAWN_EGG to ZOMBIFIED_PIGLIN_SPAWN_EGG.
* NETHER biome type was changed to NETHER_WASTES.

The above changes will automatically convert (and warn) when setting (eg. spawn_entity('PIG_ZOMBIE')), but will break
when reading in a comparison. (eg. entity_type() == 'PIG_ZOMBIE')

----

== Minecraft 1.14.4 ==
The following breaking changes exist:

* Villager professions have completely changed.
* Ocelots can no longer be tamed or sit.
* The following materials are removed but will be converted in legacy item arrays or when using set_block(): CACTUS_GREEN, DANDELION_YELLOW, ROSE_RED, SIGN, WALL_SIGN.
* TIPPED_ARROW and LINGERING_POTION entity types no longer exist and will be converted to ARROW and SPLASH_POTION respectively.

----

== Minecraft 1.13.2 / CommandHelper 3.3.3 ==
Updating to 1.13 is a major overhaul, and there was no easy way around this. Fallback behavior was created where
reasonably possible to make the transition somewhat smoother, but this will still be a large undertaking.

Block/item numeric ids are no longer guaranteed to be accurate and many material names are changed, though these will be
temporarily supported as inputs to functions for some time. This has several consequences that you'll need to address in
your scripts.

=== Item Array Format Changes ===
While you can still input old item arrays, the output of item functions and events has been changed to reflect changes
in Minecraft.

Where previously you might get an item array object in this format:

<pre>
{name: BOW, type: 262, data: 81, qty: 1, enchants: {{elevel: 1, etype: DURABLITY}},
meta: {display: null, lore: null, enchants: {{elevel: 1, etype: DURABILITY}},
unbreakable: false, flags: {}, repair: 1}}
</pre>

Now it will return an array object in this format:

<pre>
{name: BOW, qty: 1, meta: {damage: 81, display: null, lore: null, unbreakable: false,
enchants: {unbreaking: {elevel: 1, etype: DURABILITY}}, flags: {}, repair: 1}}
</pre>

Note that the keys "type", "data" and "enchants" were removed from the parent array. The old "type" numeric id has been
replaced by "name". The "data" value is only relevant for item durability now, so this was moved into the meta array
under the key "damage", and is only present if the item is damageable. (ie. if max durability is above 0) The "enchants"
key was redundant to the one in the meta array, and its format has been modified to reflect how you can't have more than
one enchantment of the same type. It now uses minecraft names for enchantment keys too, to be easier to use. (old names
and format are still accepted)

Some specific item meta keys have changed as well. For banners, "basecolor" has been removed as it's defined by the
banner item name. (eg. "RED_BANNER") Similarly, spawn eggs no longer have the "spawntype" key because that's defined by
the material name too. (eg. "BAT_SPAWN_EGG") The map "data" key has been replaced with a meta key "mapid".

Many material names under the key "name" have been changed, but will always be converted as long as they don't have a
name conflict. Most critically, you should probably address any item array with the "data" key, as these best indicate
possible conversion problems. For any hard-coded item arrays, delete the "type" and "data" keys (their presence
indicates a legacy item array and will be attempted to be converted) and rename the "name" key to the new material name.
The new materials names should be the same as in the Minecraft wiki and in-game. You can move the damage value into the
meta array if needed. A convenience function convert_legacy_item() will take an old item array and output a new item array.
This is useful for updating items that might be stored in a persistence database. The function data_name() now accepts
old material names, ids and string formats and converts them to modern material names. This is useful for conversion of
databases or maybe user input.

=== Biome Names Changed ===
These now better reflect their minecraft names. If you use get|set_biome() functions, you can look up these new enums
with reflect_pull('enum', 'BiomeType') or in the documentation.

=== Painting Names Changed ===
Two paintings just had a space added to them: BURNING_SKULL and DONKEY_KONG.

=== Item/Block String Format Deprecated ===
The "0:0" format is no longer guaranteed to be accurate, so it's deprecated wherever it's used. In most cases you will
be warned on compile time if you use these anywhere. If not, you will be warned in the log at runtime, but the
item/block will be attempted to be converted. Notably, get|set_block_at() has been deprecated for get|set_block(). If
you need to read or write block data, the get|set_blockdata_string() functions are available until further functionality
is added. These use the same format as vanilla block commands.

=== Changed DyeColor "SILVER" to "LIGHT_GRAY" ===
This now matches vanilla and material names to be easier to use. SILVER is still accepted and will be converted, but is
discouraged.

=== Recipe Keys Required ===
Recipes now require a key to be added, where previously it was optional and randomly generated. This should just be a
unique name describing the recipe you're adding. (eg. 'key': 'ice_to_packed_ice') Recipe ingredients, of course, should
use item arrays instead of the string formats.

=== CommandBlock Changes ===
In addition the vanilla changes to commands, they no longer automatically process vanilla selectors for plugin commands.
You will have to implement selectors yourself if you need this behavior.

=== Event Removals ===
The event tab_complete_chat is removed because clients no longer send these to the server. The event
player_prelogin_event is removed because it was deprecated in Spigot due to syncing issues, and it's mostly redundant to
player_login.

=== Sound Changes ===
Pre-1.9 sound names are all removed and some post 1.9 sounds have been updated to reflect 1.13. However, these will no
longer cause play_sound() to throw an exception. Instead, it will warn in the log and continue running.
play_named_sound() always behaved like this, but did so silently. play_sound() will now simply warn you if the sound
didn't play because the name is incorrect. You can refer the Minecraft wiki or the Spigot documentation for the complete
list. You can also use reflect_pull('enum', 'Sound') to get the list in a script.

=== Event Data Changes ===
The following events' prefilters, event data, and/or mutable data were updated: piston_retract, piston_extend,
block_break, block_place, block_burn, block_ignite, block_from_to, block_dispense, block_grow, note_play, block_fade,
item_despawn, item_spawn, item_drop, item_pickup, entity_change_block, entity_interact, inventory_click, inventory_drag,
item_swap, player_interact, and vehicle_collide.

While some of these are obvious or may not affect you, please refer to the event documentation to update your prefilters
and which keys you're reading from. A common theme is "item" prefilters are changed to "itemname", and like "block" keys
and prefilters, now use the material name instead of the item/block string format. (eg. "0:0") In a special case in
player_interact, if you want to check if they didn't click a block, check where "block" equals null. These are sensible
but extensive changes, so I may add a list here later. Searching for "data" in general or "item" in prefilters will help
fix a lot of them.

=== Other Changes ===
There are a number of other changes, but less critical to this guide. If you focus on the above changes, everything else
will be easier.

----

== Minecraft 1.12.1 ==
CommandBlocks now call aliases without needing /runalias. So if you have an alias for a vanilla command and there are
CommandBlocks that use the vanilla command, it may break. A manual fix is to add the "minecraft:" prefix to those
commands in the affected CommandBlocks. (eg. /fill to /minecraft:fill) To be clear, this does NOT affect CommandBlocks
that already use /runalias or vanilla commands that do not have aliases.

----

== Minecraft 1.11.2 ==
You can no longer set_exp() above 100. In 1.11.2, setting exp to exactly 100 will now give that player a new level and
reset exp to 0%. Set to 99 to avoid this.

----

== Minecraft 1.11 ==
Minecraft changed entity subtypes to be their own entity type. You may need to search for instances of "guardian",
"skeleton", "zombie", and "horse". Changing an entity's subtype using set_entity_spec() is no longer supported. Also if
you're checking for an entity type in an event bind, you'll need to update that to include a list of all subtypes.
(Example: instead of "HORSE" you'll need to check for "HORSE", "MULE", "DONKEY", "ZOMBIE_HORSE", "SKELETON_HORSE",
and/or "LLAMA".)

----

== Minecraft 1.9 ==
One or two player_interact events will fire now with the addition of the off_hand. If two, it's one for each hand. If
one, it might be the main_hand or off_hand. Some scripts need to be considered for double event firing. Any script that
looks at the item array will need to be updated for off hand support.
