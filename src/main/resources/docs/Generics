{{unimplemented}}

Generics are a way to make a class be able to specify a type which is to be determined later, and generically use
that type no matter what specific type it is. An example of this is a collection, such as array, which can be typed
using generics so that only values of a specific type can be put into the array. ''Using'' generics is a basic concept,
but creating your own is a more advanced concept.

== Using Defined Generics ==
The first place you'll likely encounter generics is simply when using classes which were defined with a generic
parameter. A good first example is the array type. In general, let's consider a simple use without generics.

<%CODE|
array @b = new array();
%>

In this case, the array is implicitely constructed with an ''auto type parameter''. We can keep the same
behavior but make it explicit by doing this:

<%CODE|
array<auto> @a = new array<auto>();
%>

In this case, we have passed the auto type to the array function/constructor. This tells the array
that we only want to allow any value to be added to or read from the array. We can instead put a specific
type here, such as number, and we will change the behavior slightly.

<%CODE|
array<number> @a = new array<number>();
%>

Now, we have told the compiler that we only want to allow numbers (and subtypes of number) to be put into the array.

<%CODE|
@a[] = 1;               // Valid, int extends number
@a[] = 3.14;            // Valid, double extends number
number @n = _procThatReturnsNumber();
@a[] = @n;              // Valid, we don't know the exact type of @n at compile time, but we know it's of type number
@a[] = "hi";            // Invalid, string doesn't extend number
auto @u = _procThatReturnsAuto();
@a[] = @u;              // Valid, but might cause a runtime error, if the type returned isn't a number
@a[] = "12345";         // Invalid, because strings do not cross cast to number, which is the implied type.
@a[] = "12345" as int;  // Valid, because string does crosscast to int, which is a subtype of number. We do have to be
                        // explicit here though.
%>

Note that we will always still be returning a value of type number, so when reading from the array, it's slightly
different.

<%CODE|
number @n0 = @a[0]; // Valid
double @n1 = @a[1]; // Invalid. Even though we put 3.14 in index 1, the compiler doesn't assume that, since it can change.
%>

In this case, we always have to refer to returned values as number, because any subtype of number can be placed into
the array, and we won't know specifically what type they are, just that they are some subclass of number.

Let's next look at how to define a class using generics.

== Defining a Class ==

In order to use generics in your own classes, you need to provide the generic type parameters in the class definition.

<%CODE|
class A<T> {}
%>

In this extremely simple class, we have defined a class named A, and stated that it has a type parameter which we are
calling <code>T</code>. (Note that in most examples, the letter T is used, but this doesn't have to be a single letter,
you can name it however you like, just like how you can name a class whatever you like.) This allows
us to use T within the class as if it were a real data type, and can use it for return values and parameter types.

<%CODE|
class A<T> {
    T @v;

    public T get() {
        return(@v);
    }

    public set(T @value) {
        this->@v = @value;
    }
}
%>

Later, when we construct an instance of A, we will provide the type as a generic parameter.

<%CODE|
A<int> @a = new A<int>();
%>

When we construct the instance with <code>int</code>, then T is effectively replaced with int for that one instance, so
you can sort of think of it as if the class had been defined like:
<%CODE|
class A {
    int @v;

    public int get() {
        return(@v);
    }

    public set(int @value) {
        this->@v = @value;
    }
}
%>

Each instance may have a different type, however. This allows us to then provide different types to the object.

<%CODE|
A<int> @ai = new A<int>();
@ai->set(12345);
int @i = @ai->get();

A<string> @as = new A<string>();
@as->set("Hello World!");
string @s = @as->get();

@as->set(12345); // Compile error, 12345 is not a string
@ai->set("Hi");  // Compile error, "Hi" is not an int
%>

== Constraints ==

So far, we've only discussed ''unconstrained'' generics, but we can define the class with a given constraint, and
then that constraint will be applied when considering the type that the object is being constructed with. There are
multiple types of constraints, and 3 different rulesets for where these constraints can be used.

<%TAKENOTE|These terms (definition site, LHS and RHS) are used throughout the rest of the article, and you should
understand them well before reading further%>

The three different locations are:
# The definition site, that is, where class A is defined
# The left hand side of an assignment (LHS)
# The right hand side of an assignment (RHS).

The terms LHS and RHS also apply to function calls, the parameters passed to a function are the RHS, and
the arguments in the function definition are the LHS. The return value of a function is also the RHS.

<%CODE|
Type @a;    // LHS
@a = @value; // RHS

proc _p(Type @n) {} // LHS
_p(@value);         // @value is RHS, also the return value from _p is RHS if it were being assigned
%>

Depending on what constraint is used, and where the constraint is used, this gives restrictions in different places in
the code. Some within the class where the generic is defined, and some at the use site of the class. Each is discussed
below.

To put these into more concrete examples:

<%CODE|
class A<T>{}        // <T> is the definition site
A<int> @a;          // This is the LHS, this is what defines the type of the variable @a
@a = new A<int>();  // This is the RHS, this is what defines the type and value that exists at runtime
%>

=== Exact Type ===

An exact type is what we've shown above. But it's worth pointing out that if the class is defined with a type, you
cannot provide an instance with a subtype for the generic parameter. Consider the following:

<%CODE|
A<int> @a = new A<int>();       // Valid
A<number> @b = new A<number>(); // Valid
A<number> @c = new A<int>();    // Invalid!
%>

While int is a subclass of number, generic parameters do not inheret in the same way. If we consider the example class
A, we can see why if we think about the difference between the LHS and RHS. Recall that the LHS and the RHS do not have
to happen in the same place in a regular assignment. If a variable is forward declared, then the RHS might come later,
and the specific value may vary depending on some runtime value.

<%CODE|
A<number> @a; // Forward declaration, @a is of type A<number>
if($input == "true") {
    @a = new A<int>(); // Compile error
} else {
    @a = new A<double>(); // Compile error
}
%>

In the above example, you might think this should work, but it doesn't. But let's assume it did work, and consider
what happens lower in the code if we tried to use @a. Remember, the T defined in A would be defined as number.

<%CODE|
@a->set(1.0); // 1.0 (a double) is a number. However, what if $input had been true?
%>

Now, if $input is false, this should work fine, because A's T value is a double. But what happens if $input was true?
Then all of a sudden, this will stop working! Inside of A's set function, we would have tried to assign a double to an
int.

Therefore, when simply providing an unbounded type parameter, you MUST use the same value on the LHS and RHS.

This does not constrain you in what values you can pass when using the class though. This is perfectly valid:

<%CODE|
A<number> @a = new A<number>();
int @value = 1234;
@a->set(@value); // This works, despite @value being an int
//int @return = @a->get(); // Compile error, we're trying to assign number to int
number @return = @a->get(); // This works though
%>

The only "catch" here is that T is of type number, so the return type is also a number, and even though we know we sent
it an int, it can in general return a double as well, so the call to get() must accept that possibility.

This is also the only type of constraint which supports <code>auto</code>, and the only type where the object can be
used without generics despite the class being defined with a generic parameter.

<%CODE|
A @a = new A(); // Valid, equivalent to the next line
A<auto> @a = new A<auto>();
%>

=== Upper/Lower Bound ===

==== LHS/RHS ====

However, we might not want this behavior, we might want to sometimes actually have a subclass in the generic parameter.
If so, we can use a boundary constraint, which is defined on the LHS. Let's consider an upper bound first. An upper
bound is defined with the syntax <code>? extends Type</code>. The question mark (called a wildcard) is there because
we aren't actually defining a generic parameter here (like T), we're simply saying that the RHS for this must match this
constraint.

<%CODE|
A<? extends number> @a;
if($input == "true") {
    @a = new A<int>(); // Now this works!
} else {
    @a = new A<double>(); // Now this works!
}
%>

But won't we just run into the same problem as discussed above? No, but that's because the code now has additional
restrictions on it. When we do this, whenever T is used on the RHS, it is treated as if it is a number, but it isn't
allowed to be on the LHS at all. Why? Assume @a was defined as in the above code.

<%CODE|
number @n = @a->get(); // Valid! @a definitely contains a number
@a->set(1.0); // Not valid! What if $input had been true? @a would be A<int>, so this would cause an error.
%>

This begs the question, how would we get a value into A in the first place then? There are a number of ways, but
mostly it involves temporary transfers or casts.


<%CODE|
A<? extends number> @a;
if($input == "true") {
    A<int> @temp = new A<int>();
    @temp->set(1);
    @a = @temp;
} else {
    @a = new A<double>();
    (@a as A<double>)->set(1.0);
}
@a->get(); // Either 1 or 1.0 depending on the value of $input
%>

In the first example, we're creating a temporary variable, where on the LHS, we declare it to only hold ints. Then, we
can use the methods in the class unrestricted. Then, we assign that to @a, where the restrictions exist. In the second
example, we're casting the value @a to A&lt;double&gt;, which in this case we can clearly see will be fine, but once we
leave the else block, won't necessarily be. The compiler can't figure this out though, so it needs the cast to be told
that this is safe in this one instance.

If we don't care about the type at all, we can also use the constraint <code>?</code>, which is usually just shorthand for
<code>? extends mixed</code> when the type on the definition is unbounded.

<%CODE|
class A<T> {}

A<?> @a;
switch($input) {
    case "1": @a = new A<int>();
    case "2": @a = new A<string>();
    case "3": @a = new A<array>();
}
%>

Now, depending on the input, we will have any potential subclass, and so when we call get(), we can only assume that
it's of type mixed.

This does change slightly however, if the class definition has provided an upper bound. See below.

==== Upper Bound in Definition ====

We may want to generally constrain the value of T to some class OR subclass from within the class itself.
We can do that with this code:

<%CODE|
class A<T extends number> {}
%>

Now, when we instantiate a new instance of A, we are required to provide a type which extends number, such as int or
double (or number itself), or another wildcard upper bound, with the upper bound on that being number or lower.

<%CODE|
A<number> @a = new A<number>();         // Valid
A<int> @i = new A<int>();               // Valid
A<? extends number> @e = new A<int>;    // Valid, <? extends number> on the LHS is a subtype of
                                        //      <? extends number> in the definition
A<string> @s = new A<string>();         // Invalid! string does not extend number
%>

Now, from within the class A, we can always treat the ''input parameter'' values of type T as if they are a number,
so any operations defined in number will be applicable and allowed.

<%CODE|
class A<T extends number> {
    public T triple(T @value) {
        return(@value * 3); // All numbers can be multiplied, so if this is either an int or a double, this will still work
    }
}
%>

If the class definition contains an upper bound, then the behavior of the plain wildcard varies as well. In the example
above, <code>?</code> would be equivalent to <code>? extends number</code>.

<%CODE|
A<?> @a = new A<int>();     // Valid
A<?> @a = new A<string>();  // Invalid
%>

=== Lower Bound (super) ===

A lower bound is the opposite of an upper bound. This is generally less useful than an upper bound, but it is useful
for write-only values. Consider the following definition of @a.

<%CODE|
A<? super number> @a;
if($input == "true") {
    @a = new A<primitive>();
} else {
    @a = new A<mixed>();
}
%>

In this case, @a is defined with the generic type <code>? super number</code>. This means that the type on the RHS must
contain a type which is a superclass of number. number has two superclasses, primitive, and mixed, so these are the
only two options in this case. As in the above example, we use either primitive or mixed, based on the value of $input.

In principal, a lower bound acts in reverse of an upper bound. This means that the values are "write only", that is,
whenever T is used on the LHS, it is treated as if it is a number, but it isn't allowed to be on the RHS at all
(actually, it is, but then it's treated as if it's of type mixed). Let's consider why this is. Let's write some values
into @a.

<%CODE|
@a->set(1.0); // double is a number, this is fine
@a->set(42); // int is also a number, so this is also fine
%>

In both cases, writing either a double or an int into a value of type number, primitive, or mixed, will all work just
fine. But we can't read the values from the object, (or at least we can't assume they're numbers) because in general,
code elsewhere could have written non-numbers into the object.

<%CODE|
A<? super number> @a;
A<mixed> @temp = new A<mixed>();
@temp->set('string'); // Valid, because a string is a subtype of mixed
@a = @temp; // Valid, because <mixed> is a supertype of <? super number>
number @n = @a->get(); // Invalid! This would return a string.
mixed @m = @a->get(); // Valid, but only because everything is of type mixed
%>

In general, a lower bound is useful in less cases than an upper bound, but can come in handy sometimes.

Note that lower bounds cannot be used in generic definitions, the following doesn't make any sense.

<%CODE|
class A<T super number> { // Invalid!
    T @v; // We would always just have to consider T to be of type mixed, because it might be constructed with new A<mixed>()
}
%>

If you think you want to do this, you can get the intended behavior by just using mixed instead of T from within the
class, and not having a generic parameter at all.

=== Constructor Constraint ===

A constructor constraint asserts that the given type has a constructor with the specified signature. An example with
the no-argument constructor would be this:

<%CODE|
class A<new T()> {}
%>

This constrains the caller such that they must now provide an instance of a class which contains a no argument, public
constructor. From within the class though, we are then able to construct a new instance of T.

<%CODE|
class A<new T()> {
    public T getInstance() {
        return(new T());
    }
}

class MyClass {
    public MyClass() {}
}

A<MyClass> @a = new A<MyClass>();
MyClass @newInstance = @a->getInstance();

// Note on the LHS, we could have used ? if we don't generally care about the specific type, though that means
// that we have to treat T as mixed when it's used on the RHS, unless there were additional constraints
A<?> @dontcare = new A<MyClass>();
mixed @m = @dontcare->getInstance();
%>

We can also provide parameters to <code>new T()</code> to state that there must be a public constructor which accepts
the specified types.

<%CODE|
// Assume X, Y, and Z are classes
class A<new T(X, Y, Z)> {
    public T getInstance() {
        return(new T(new X(), new Y(), new Z()));
    }
}

class MyClass {
    public MyClass(X @x, Y @y, Z @z) {}
}

A<MyClass> @a = new A<MyClass>();
MyClass @newInstance = @a->getInstance();
%>

This is useful in cases where you may need to construct a new instance of T from within the class, such as in a factory
class or similar. The constructor constraint cannot be used on the RHS generic parameter.

=== Annotation Constraint ===

An annotation constraint states that the class passed in to the generic parameter must have a specific annotation
on it.

<%CODE|
class A<@{NonNull} T> {
    public void print(T @obj) {
        // Since T has @{NonNull}, then we know we can never assign null to a variable of this type,
        // thus this code is guaranteed to never throw a NullPointerException.
        msg(@obj->toString());
    }
}
%>

Any annotation which can be put on a class type may be used, but there is no way to specify the specific annotation
parameters themselves.

== Multiple Constraints ==

So far we have only discussed single constraints, however, it is possible to specify that the generic type match
multiple constraints at the same time. These are separated by the <code>&amp;</code> symbol.

<%CODE|
class A<T extends ArrayAccess & T extends Sizeable & new T()> {
    public void test() {
        T @t = new T();     // We can construct a new instance of this type...
        length(@t);         // We can check the length of it (from Sizeable)...
        mixed @m = @t[0];   // And we can use bracket accessors on it (from ArrayAccess).
    }
}

class MyClass implements ArrayAccess, Sizeable {
    public MyClass() {}
    // etc
}

A<? extends ArrayAccess & ? extends Sizeable & new()> @a = new A<MyClass>();
%>

Note that the type variable name in the definition site must be the same within each constraint, in this case, T.

The more constraints you have, the more typing you have to do. You may consider defining all the constraints
in a [[Typedefs|typedef]].

<%CODE|
typedef AConstraints = T extends ArrayAccess & T extends Sizeable & new T();
class A<AConstraints> {}

A<AConstraints> @a = ...;
%>

Note that typedefs automatically translate the type variable (in this case T) into the appropriate wildcard when used
on the LHS. Typedefs of constraints cannot be used on the RHS, as a concrete class must always be provided there.

== Multiple Parameters ==

Some classes might wish to provide type parameters. This is possible by comma separating them.

<%CODE|
class A<T, U> {
    T @t;
    U @u;
}

A<string, number> @a = new A<string, number>();
%>

== Variadic Type Parameters ==

The number of type parameters on the class can also vary.

<%CODE|
class A<T...> {
    public void method(T... @values) {
        /* */
    }
}
%>

When used in this way, T can only be used as a type of a variadic parameter in methods, and cannot be used as the type
of a field or of the return type of a method. When constructing an instance of this type, we must specify the types on
the LHS, as well as the RHS.

<%CODE|
A<string, int> @a = new A<string, int>();
// Now method() is defined as if it were method(string, int)
@a->method('string', 1);
@a->method(); // Compile error! Expected (string, int), but found ()
%>

Variadic type parameters can be used in combination with multiple parameters, but it must be last in the list. It may
have additional constraints, however.

From within the class, we won't know the type of T at compile time, but the types are still reified anyways, and T will
actually be defined as <code>array&lt;ClassType&gt;</code>, and can be iterated at runtime to get the types that were
defined on that specific instance.

One great example of this is how Callable is implemented.

<%CODE|
class Callable<Return, Parameters...> {
    public Return invoke(Parameters... @parameters) {
        ...
    }
}
%>

This is what mechanism you're using when when you define a fully typed closure.

<%CODE|
Callable<string, int, int> @closure = string closure(int @i, int @j) {
    return(string(@i + @j));
}
%>

You can also define variadic parameter types in the LHS.

<%CODE|
Callable<string, string...> @c = string closure(string... @s) {};
%>

By default, if this isn't specified, it uses the type <code>auto...</code>

<%CODE|
// These two lines are equivalent
Callable @c;
Callable<auto, auto...> @d;
%>

== Type Parameters on Methods ==

So far in the article, we have only discussed type parameters on classes, but these can be scoped to a single method
as well. The syntax for this is such:

<%CODE|
class A {
    public <T> T method(T @value) {
        msg(typeof(T)); // Note that we're printing out the type of T when we call the method
        return(@value);
    }
}
%>

This defines that a type parameter named T will be used just within this method, and then it can be used as either the
return type or the parameter types. In this example, since we're using T for both the return and parameter types, then
that means that if we call the method and send it an int, then it will also return an int. The binding of the specific
type of T can happen in a number of ways. Usually, it guesses the type of T correctly, and if you use the same type
everywhere, this will be correct. However, you may wish to specify a superclass, in which case you'll need to explicitly
specify this on the method use site.

<%CODE|
A @a = new A();
int @i = @a->method(1); // T is int. This can be inferred because all the types match
number @n = @a->method(2); // T is number. This is also inferred, by finding the least common supertype of number and int
@a->method(3); // T is int. The return type isn't used, so only 3 is used to get the type. But if we wanted T to be number, we can do...
@a-><number>method(3); // Now T is number (int is a subclass of number, so this is still valid code)
%>

This is how the {{function|array}} function is defined, and why the following is the same:

<%CODE|
array<int> @a = array();            // T is inferred to be int
array<int> @b = <int>array();       // Explicit assignment of int to T
array<int> @c = new array<int>();   // Now we're using the new operator, not calling a function, so it has different syntax

array<? extends number> @d = <int>array(); // Different than @b, but this time we needed to be explicit
%>

== Inferred Type Parameters (Diamond Operator) ==

In all the above examples, we have been explicit about the type passed to the RHS, but this isn't always necessary.
We can instead on the RHS used the ''inferred type'', if that is correct, and simply omit the type on the RHS.

<%CODE|
class A<T> {}

A<number> @a = new A<>(); // equivalent to new A<number>()
A<number> @a = new A(); // Different! Compiler error is issued here, this is equivalent to new A<auto>()
%>

Note that unlike usual types, the generic type auto cannot be used in the same way, that is, <code>&lt;auto&gt;</code>
is not simply an untyped generic, but rather, a specific generic type which can contain any value.

Different types of constraints have different inference rules.

<%CODE|
A<? extends number> @a = new A<>(); // Inferred type new A<number>()
A<? super number> @a = new A<>(); // Inferred type new A<number>()
A<new()> @a = new A<>(); // Compile error, new() cannot be inferred

class B<T...> {}
B<string, int> @b = new B<>(); // Inferred type new B<string, int>()
%>

When there are multiple parameters, some of them may not be inferrable, while others are. In that case, you can
force inference of the ones that are inferrable by using ? on the RHS for those, and providing the specific parameters
where not inferrable.

<%CODE|
class C<T, new(), U...> {}

C<number, new(), string, int> @c = new C<?, MyClass, ?>(); // Inferred to new C<number, MyClass, string, int>()
%>

== <code>auto</code> type with generics ==

In general, using auto types defers typechecking to runtime. However, with generics, this can lead to situations
where the typechecking error would end up happening in totally unrelated code, and so isn't allowed even though
auto types are generally a supported feature. Therefore, there are special rules
surrounding the use of auto in generic parameters. In general, it is allowed to be used with unbounded generics.

<%CODE|
class A<T> {}

A<auto> @a = new A<auto>();
%>

However, most of the other constraints have problems when using auto types. Since auto doesn't generally
inheret from anything that we can determine at compile time (except mixed), it cannot be used in case there is an upper
bound on the LHS or definition site, where the upper bound is anything other than mixed.

<%CODE|
A<? extends number> @a = new A<auto>(); // Compile error
%>

It also can't be used in case of a lower bound, for any value. A lower bound of mixed could be theoretically fine, but
that is generally not allowed anyways, since only mixed is a superclass of mixed.

It also can't be used when the class has a new constraint.

<%CODE|
class A<new T()> {
    public T construct() {
        return(new T());
    }
}

A<auto> @a = new A<auto>(); // Compile error. This would cause construct to run `new auto()`. What would `new auto()` mean?
%>

It also cannot be used on annotation constraints, since the constraints ensure that the class provides a certain
annotation.

Finally, it cannot be used at the type of either lower or upper bounds. (<code>T extends auto</code> for instance).

This doesn't stop the LHS of the assignment from being auto, however. This is allowed.

<%CODE|
auto @a = new A<int>();
// Now @a is untyped at compile time, so no typechecking is done
int @i = @a->get(); // Works, but unchecked for compile errors and so not generally recommended
%>

== Conclusion ==

At a basic level, generics are fairly easy to understand, but especially with some of the constraints and more
advanced techniques, it can be fairly difficult to understand, so don't be discouraged if you don't get everything in
this article at first. Try things out yourself, and run the code yourself to see how things change.
