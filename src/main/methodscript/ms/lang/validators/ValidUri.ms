/**
 * Meant to be tagged on strings that are intended to represent URIs. The URI must
 * be formatted according to RFC 3987 (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3987.html).
 * <p>
 * Note that URIs are a very specific standard, and many programs do not
 * accept what should otherwise be a valid URI based on the standard, so
 * validating against this only provides a small amount of assurance that
 * this will be a *useful* URI, however, if it does not match this, it
 * most assureadly is not a URI.
