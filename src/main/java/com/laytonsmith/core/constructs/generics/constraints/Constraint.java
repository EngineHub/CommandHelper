/**
 * A Constraint is a single part of the general declaration. For instance, in the declaration
 * <code>T extends number & new T(A, B, C)</code>, this has two constraints, the first being
 * <code>T extends number</code> and the second being <code>new T(A, B, C)</code>. The first is an UpperBoundConstraint,
 * and the second is a ConstructorConstraint. A third example is a LowerBoundConstraint, which is for constraints
 * defined with <code>T super number</code>, and finally, an exact constraint, which is simply a ClassType.
 * <p>
 * In general, two different Constraints may be contradictory, and when used in combination, erroneous. The solver for
 * this isn't built in to the Constraint class however, since you need to know all constraints in the generic to
 * determine if the combination is erroneous. Individually, a constraint cannot itself be erroneous.
 * <p>
 * Constraints can be placed in 3 different locations.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Definitions - That is, a class or method definition</li>
 * <li>LHS - Function parameter definitions or LHS of an assignment</li>
 * <li>RHS - Function parameters, RHS of an assignment</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Different constraints are valid in different locations, though the RHS can only contain an ExactTypeConstraint
 * constraint, and so isn't grouped as part of the Constraint heirarchy itself.
 * <p>
 * For the Definition site and LHS sites though, some constraints are simply not valid at all, and others must be used
 * as a wildcard.
 * <p>
 * Note that while the class implements Comparable, the order is not well defined, and is subject to change. This is an
 * implementation detail to allow lists of Contraint objects to be ordered in a normal, deterministic way, in order to
 * be properly comparable against other lists of Constraints. The specific order should not be relied upon beyond the
 * execution of a single process.
