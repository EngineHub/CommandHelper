/**
 * This class represents a fully qualified class name. It is better to fully qualify the type once, and then pass that
 * around, rather than passing around a string. Other than the static validation methods, this class is a fairly thin
 * wrapper around a String containing the fully qualified class name, and the validation methods are trivial to bypass,
 * because during the intermediate phases of compilation, the fully qualified class name may be used, but the actual
 * class it represents isn't defined yet (but will be, eventually, in the non compile-error case). In general, it's
 * only possible to use the fully qualified name based on user code in a few cases, namely during object definition,
 * where the name of the object is by definition whatever the user input. In other cases based on user code,
 * {@link UnqualifiedClassName} should be used instead, which can easily be converted to a FullyQualifiedClassName once
 * the object table has been completed, and will throw the appropriate exceptions once the compilation stages are all
 * complete, and object definitions have been completed entirely.
