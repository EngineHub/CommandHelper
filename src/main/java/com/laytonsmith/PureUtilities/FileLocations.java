/**
 * This class contains several constant file locations, which can be used throughout the rest of the application. It
 * also includes a static factory method, which can be used to get the default class. Subclasses should be sure to call
 * the parent's static getter method, so that chaining will work properly throughout the application. This particular
 * class is agnostic to the application itself, and so only provides generic locations that may be useful to most Java
 * applications. The controller for the application should use the most specific subclass available when starting up the
 * application, though classes themselves should use as generic a class as possible when requesting file information.
 * Files are immutable, and likely are cached.
