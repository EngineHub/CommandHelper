/**
 * A Wildcard object is a regex-like matcher, which uses a greatly simplified
 * syntax, and is useful only for specific application needs. A Wildcard is used
 * to specify a fuzzy match on file patters, namespace patterns, or other
 * segmented data. A Wildcard object must be constructed with a separator
 * character and a pattern, and then data can be fed to it to be matched.
 * Wildcards only support 3 special symbols, *, **, and ?, and support escaping
 * of those characters for literals with a backslash. A * symbol matches all
 * characters across one and only one segment, ** matches all characters across
 * any number of segments, and ? matches any one character. For instance, if you
 * have a file path: /home/user/files/file.html, then the separator would be a
 * "/", and to match this file, you might use the pattern
 * "/home/user/files/*.htm?" This pattern would also match
 * /home/user/files/file2.htm, /home/user/files/file3.html, etc, but it would
 * not match /home/user/files/resources/frame.html, because the last match does
 * not span segments. However, "/home/user/files/**.htm?" would match.
