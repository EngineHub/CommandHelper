/**
 * This annotation ties the class to the "super interface" that this class will implement
 * certain methods for. Ideally, we would just have the interfaces implement the methods required by @typeof,
 * but that won't work in Java &lt; 8, which we need to support. Instead, we have a real class that extends
 * {@link MScriptInterfaceRunner} and uses this annotation to link it to the parent interface. Methods
 * that are forced in all subclasses using {@link ForceImplementation} can use this to provide the implementations
 * for interfaces. This also works for abstract classes.
