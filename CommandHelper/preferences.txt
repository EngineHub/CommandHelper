#Makes CommandHelper play dirty and break all sorts of programming rules, so that other plugins can't interfere with the operations that you defined. Note that doing this essentially makes CommandHelper have absolute say over commands. Use this setting only if you can't get another plugin to cooperate with CH, because it is a global setting.
